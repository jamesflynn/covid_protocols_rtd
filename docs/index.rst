COVID-19 Critical Care Clinical Guidelines

Updated: 3/19/2020

This document is a work in progress. We have much to learn.

This is updated daily with evolving information; do not print.

Please send suggestions: \ BWHCOVIDGuidelines@gmail.com\  

Disclaimer:This document is intended as a resource for clinicians caring
for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, based on available evidence and
recommendations of governing bodies. The recommendations do not replace
clinical judgment or the need for individualized patient care plans.
While we attempt to keep this document up-to-date, the literature on
COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and we suggest that practitioners search
for the most up-to-date literature on any specific topic. These
guidelines will also rapidly evolve as they are implemented into
clinical practice and we receive feedback from practitioners. Finally,
these guidelines were developed based on practice patterns and
infrastructure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA; local
factors should be taken into account if utilized at other hospitals.

Chapter 1: Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers
================================================

#. .. rubric:: Clinical Course ofCOVID-19 
      :name: h.a8294aye0lbq

#. Clinical presentation:non-specific, flu-like illness

#. Fever  (44-98%)
#. Cough  (46-82%)
#. SOB  (20-64%)
#. URI  (5-25%)
#. GI sx  (10%; usually before respiratory sx)

2. Transmission:

#. Large droplets and fomites
#. Incubation period: typi        cally 2-7d, up to 14d
#. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus

3. Course for admitted patients:

#. ~ 80% don’t require critical care
#. ~ 10-20% develop bacterialsuperinfection 
#. ~ 30% developARDS
#. ~ 5% develop renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy
#. Transaminemia is common; fulminant hepatitis not yet reported
#. Reports of cardiomyopathy in critically ill patients; some progress
   to cardiogenic shock late in course
#. The data on rates of viral co-infection
   isincomplete\ `[a] <#cmnt1>`__\ .

4. Reasons for ICU admission:

#. Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common indication for ICU.

#. Reports of rapid progression to intubation within 12-24h

2. Few patients present with shock, can develop late in course
3. Median time from symptom onset to ICU transfer is ~10 days

5. Poor prognostic indicators:

#. Demographics: Age > 65, male
#. Comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (including HTN), pulmonary
   disease, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression
#. Lab findings: severe lymphopenia, elevated TnT, elevated Cr, elevated
   LDH, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer

6. Cause of death:

#.  Cause of death in retrospective study from Wuhan of 68 patients who
   died of COVID (Ruan et al,Intensive Care Med, 2020):

#. 53% (n=36) respiratory failure
#. 7% (n=5) myocardial damage/ heart failure
#. 33% (n=22) concomitant respiratory & heart failure
#. 7% (n=5) unknown causes

2. Mortality rate appears to correlate closely with age and availability
   of medical resources

2. .. rubric:: Non-ICU Management Principles
      :name: h.ymvixg917k3e

#. Diagnostic studies:

#. Labs

#. On admission: CBC with differential, BMP, LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer,
   Troponin / CPK, PTT / INR, Procalcitonin
#. Daily: CBC with differential, BMP

#. For stable floor patients, consider every other day

3. Every other day: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin / CPK (if in ICU),
   Triglycerides (if on propofol)
4. If clinical worsening: LFTs, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, Troponin, CPK, PTT /
   INR, Procalcitonin, Ferritin, Fibrinogen
5. Expert opinion does not recommend routine pro-BNP.

2. Chest imaging: Portable CXR is sufficient in most cases, and the
   utility of daily CXR should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

#. Chest imaging variable; bilateral patchy opacities most common
#. Chest CT often will not change treatment and should only be obtained
   only if necessary due to risks and time associated with transport and
   decontamination of equipment.
#. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs can be used in lieu of
   Chest Xray by experienced providers

3. Baseline EKG
4. Obtain additional studies only if necessary

#. No routine TTEs (for cardiac studies, see  “Cardiac Complications of
   COVID” chapter).

2. Medical management:

#. Management is supportive
#. Fluid management should be conservative due to risk of hypoxia/CHF

#. Do not use maintenance fluids

3. Antiviral and immune-modulating therapies are investigational (see
   “COVID Therapies and Clinical Trials”)

3. Early Advance Care Planning:

#. In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form
#. Discuss and document goals of care on admission

#. Educate patient and family on disease course
#. Focus on desired quality of life and tolerance for ICU measures

#. Avoid implying availability of ICU measures if unknown (refer to
   local ethics guidance)

4. Avoid increasing risk of transmission:Generally avoid transport if
   possible.

#. Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV: BiPAP, CPAP), High
   Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), Humidified Venturi Face Masks, Nebulizers
   increase aerosolization.

#. Any aerosol-generating intervention must be performed under Strict
   (Airborne) Isolation Precautions
#. In current policy, patients with severe OSA may continue nocturnal
   CPAP / BiPAP butmust use a BWH NIPPVmask andmachine, not their home
   mask or nasal pillows which have elevated aerosol risk. BWH machines
   have dual limb (with HEPA filter); in contrast, home machine have a
   single limb so have an anti-asphyxiation (pop-off) valve that
   increases aerosol risk.
#. Use metered dose inhalers instead of nebulizers.
#. If patient already on BiPAP / CPAP / HFNC becomes COVID-suspected,
   transition to non-rebreather followed by intubation.
#. NIPPV\* is not used for ARDS; early intubation is preferred.

\*Can be considered on case-by-case basis for highly reversible
indications (e.g.,flash pulmonary edema with rapid resolution).

6. Similar to many U.S. medical centers, our current default is to avoid
   HFNC in DNI patients and to use NRB, although exceptions can be
   considered on a case-by-case basis.

3. .. rubric:: Triage to ICU
      :name: h.tsr53lmedjah

#. Consult the ICU triage team EARLY for: 

#. Provider concern
#. Respiratory distress

#. Need O2 > 6 LPM to maintain SpO2 > 92 or PaO2 > 65.
#. Rapid escalation of oxygen requirement.
#. Significant work of breathing.

3. Hemodynamic instability after initialconservative fluid resuscitation

#. SBP < 90, Mean arterial pressure < 65, or Heart rate > 120.

4. Acidosis

#. ABG with pH < 7.3 or PCO2 > 50 or above patient’s baseline.
#. Lactate > 2.

5. Need for intensive nursing care or frequent laboratory draws
   requiring arterial line.
6. Severe comorbid illness / high risk for deterioration.

4. .. rubric:: Transfer Process
      :name: h.32yrxx2cn5j

#. Additional details in Strict Isolation Procedures Manual.
#. Floor / ED to ICU:

#. ICU RN brings ICU bed to the floor for transfer (to avoid bed
   transfer in COVID precautions room and subsequent bed cleaning).
#. Patient wears surgical mask, with an extra clean gown and sheet on
   top.  
#. Providers wear standard PPE during transport.
#. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE
#. Necessary tests (e.g. CT), should be obtained during transfer if
   possible.

3. ICU to floor:

#. RN wears standard PPE
#. Patient travels in wheelchair or stretcher
#. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE

4. Floor to discharge: see separate documentation of discharge criteria/
   planning 

#. RN wears standard PPE
#. Patient travels in wheelchair
#. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE
#. Patient is escorted directly into vehicle; contact care management if
   patient does not have access to a personal vehicle

Chapter 2: Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients
====================================================

#. .. rubric:: Respiratory Failure and ARDS
      :name: h.5z5wj4l0ghah

#. Pathophysiology:

#. Histology showsbilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular
   fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, pulmonary edema,
   and hyaline membrane formation (Xu et al.,Lancet Respir Med,2020)
#. Some evidence of direct viral injury to lung tissue, rather than
   purely hyperinflammatory process (Xu et al.,Lancet Respir Med, 2020)

2. Time course:

#. Anecdotal reports that progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure
   occurs rapidly (within ~12-24 hours)
#. From onset of symptoms, median time to:

#. Development of ARDS: 8-12 days (Wang et al.,JAMA, 2020; Zhou et
   al.,Lancet, 2020; Huang et al.,Lancet, 2020)
#. Mechanical ventilation: 10.5-14.5 days (Huang et al.,Lancet, 2020;
   Zhou et al.,Lancet, 2020)

2. .. rubric:: Management of Hypoxemia
      :name: h.z178d8l3t5u1

#. Supplemental Oxygen:

#. Humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1 to 6 LPM for target SpO2 92-96%

2. Escalation:

#. If a patient requires > 6 LPM NC, initiatedry Venturi mask
   (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk)

#. Start Venturi mask at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%
#. Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not exceeding FiO2 35%)
#. If FiO2 > 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM

2. Notify ICU triage pager

3. Avoidhigh-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)and non-invasive positive pressure
   ventilation (NIPPV;i.e. CPAP/BiPAP) for ARDS.

#. Patients on nocturnal NIPPV at home should continue their nocturnal
   NIPPV. However, patient must use BWH NIPPVmask andmachine (not home
   mask/nasal pillow or machine due to increased aerosol risk with home
   pillows/mask/machine) under strict airborne precautions.  
#. If a patient already on HFNC or NIPPV becomes a COVID-19 PUI,
   transition to non-rebreather if safe

#. Ideally, the patient should be off an aerosol generating device like
    HFNC or NIPPV for 45 minutes prior to intubation, but it is
   definitely not a requirement.  

3. If a patient isDNR/DNI orotherwise is not eligible for intubation:

#. Current policy is to default to avoiding HFNC or NIPPV in DNI / DNR
   patients. However, neither HFNC nor NIPPV is prohibited and
   case-by-case exceptions could apply.
#. This is an evolving area without definitive evidence or uniform
   policy that underwent multi-disciplinary discussion.
#. Considerations include:

-  Safety of staff (particularly Resp. Therapy and nursing);
-  Paucity of data on the increased aerosol risk; 
-  WHO interim guidelines (published 2020 Mar 13) on COVID-19 are more
   liberal about the usage of HFNC and NIPPV, stating that systems with
   “good interface fitting [i.e., good seal, no air leak] do not create
   widespread dispersion of exhaled air and therefore should be
   associated with low risk of airborne transmission.”
-  Difficulty in assessing how many patients that fail Non-Rebreathing
   mask would survive if given HFNC.
-  Pro-active treatment of air hunger through other means.
-  HFNC has been utilized in lieu of ventilation of both full code and
   DNI / DNR patients in the setting of limited resources.

If HFNC or NIPPV used

#. For HFNC, have patient wear a surgical mask if possible. andtry to
   limit flow rate to < 30 L/min
#. For BiPAP, use an in-line viral filter.
#. Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is no air leak, as leaks
   propel potentially infected air significant distances (see below)

4. Rationale: General consensus suggests that HFNC and NIPPV increase
   the risk of viral transmission. Given the rapid progression of
   disease, we do not expect many patients can be salvaged/avoid
   intubation using HFNC/NIPPV, but this is unknown

#. A systematic review on SARS found that NIPPV was associated with
   increased risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers (n=2
   studies), but HFNC was not (n=1) (Tran et al.,PLoS One, 2012)
#. Other studies with very limited power exist, such as a post-hoc
   analysis that found no secondary infections in medical staff from
   patients with influenza H1N1 treated with HFNC but was limited to
   only n=20 (Relloet al.,J Crit Care.2012\ `[b] <#cmnt2>`__\ );  
#. Exhaled air distances are minimally increased with CPAP pressures up
   to 20 cm H2O and HFNC up to 60 LPM; device/interface leaks cause
   significant lateral air travel (Hui et al.,Eur Respir Ji, 2019)

4. Early intubation:

#. If FiO2 requirements are rising rapidly, we recommendearly
   consultation with anesthesia for possible intubation

#. Case reports from China suggest high failure rates for non-invasive
   ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen (Zuo et al.,Chin Med
   Sci J, 2020)

2. Once FiO2=60% and SpO2 < 92%, call for intubation if patient is a
   candidate for mechanical ventilation

#. There is aCOVID Airway Code Team with specific protocols for avoiding
   aerosolization.
#. Many centers suggest Rapid Sequence Intubation when fully paralyzed,
   without ambu-bag (which generates aerosols) and highly experienced
   operators (e.g., anesthesia attending).

3. Other indications for intubation (tachypnea, work of breathing)
   apply 

 

3. .. rubric:: Initial Mechanical Ventilation
      :name: h.welz4k559gib

#. Intubations outside of ICU:

#. Should be attended by the Resource RT, who can facilitate early and
   appropriate ventilator settings with non-intensivists
#. Use “Mechanical Ventilation with Sedation” orderset

2. Initiate Volume Control (AC/VC) mode
3. Initial tidal volume (Vt): 

#. Vt = 6 ml/kg (based on ideal body weight [IBW] from ARDSnet table
   -see table)

#. IBW men (kg)= 50 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)
#. IBW women (kg)= 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)

4. Initial respiratory rate 16-24, higher if acidosis present
5. Initial PEEP based on BMI:

#. BMI < 35: PEEP 10
#. BMI 35 to 50: PEEP 12
#. BMI > 50: PEEP 15

6. Initial FiO2:

#. 100% immediately post-intubation, then rapidly wean to SpO2 92-96%
   (Barrot et al.,N Engl J Med, 2020)

7. Obtain STAT portable CXR to confirm endotracheal tube location: 

#. Order and page radiology at time of intubation
#. Prioritize CXR and vent titration over procedures (such as central
   venous catheter placement) if possible.

8. Within 30 minutes of intubation, obtain an ABG (preferred) or a VBG
   and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed

4. .. rubric:: PEEP and Mechanics
      :name: h.mcb6j64zp5u6

#. If patients supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator (most common),
   perform the following within 10 minutes of intubation:

#. Determine best PEEP following intubationwhile paralyzed using
   Pressure-Volume (PV) tool

#. This is a departure from use of Best PEEP Trials. PV tool is the
   preferred method due to widespread familiarity with RT staff,
   institutional experience, and minimizing provider exposure

2. If patients not supported by Hamilton G5 Ventilator, perform the
   following within 10 minutes of intubation:

#. Initiate PEEP at BMI settings above and titrate PEEP according to
   ARDSnet Lower PEEP table. Currently, after discussion, both MGH and
   BWH recommend the lower PEEP table as a back-up if PEEP cannot be
   individualized (e.g., experienced respiratory therapists or
   intensivists unavailable). The lower (rather than higher) PEEP table
   was selected primarily to avoid doing initial harm patients with poor
   lung compliance.

3. After best PEEP determined, obtain respiratory mechanics:

#. Plateau pressure (with goal < 30, management below)
#. Static compliance

4. Obtain arterial blood gas:

#. Goal pH 7.25 to 7.45
#. Calculate P/F ratio from initial post-intubation ABG

5. Routine esophageal balloon use is not recommended

5. .. rubric:: Targeting Sedation for Ventilator Synchrony
      :name: h.nhqe52dtgmrn

#. Initially targetRASS -2 to -3 (see table):

#. Maintain deep sedation immediately post-intubation while paralyzed
   (assume 60 minutes for Rocuronium, 10 minutes for succinylcholine)

#. Preferred initial sedation regimen: 

#. Fentanyl/Hydromorphone (boluses +/- infusion) + Propofol: target
   analgosedation and optimize analgesia first while decreasing sedative
   requirements
#. Measure triglycerides every third day on propofol or earlier if other
   reasons for hypertriglyceridemia

2. Adjunct agent: Midazolam
3. Use dexmedetomidine only when nearing extubation

2. Target ventilator synchrony:Ventilator-induced lung injury (VALI) is
   common in patients who are not synchronous with the ventilator and
   can cause significant lasting damage

#. Once at target RASS after paralytics have worn off, assess patient
   synchrony with the ventilator (e.g. signs of breath-stacking, double
   triggering, other ventilator alarms)

#. Titrate sedatives/analgesics to ventilator synchrony allowing for
   deeper RASS
#. If patient remains dyssynchronous despite deep sedation (RASS -5),
   initiate continuous paralytics(ensure BIS 40 to 60 prior to
   initiating and during paralysis)

6. .. rubric:: General Management of Ventilated ARDS Patients
      :name: h.f3ug6fi0aj01

#. Consider whether patient requires daily CXR:

#. CXR clearly indicated for:

#. Clinical change
#. Concern for displaced ET tube:

#. Sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure or resistance
#. Decreased, unilateral breath sounds (usually on the right)
#. RN or RT concern for change in depth of ET tube at teeth

2. COVID-19 ICU Bundle:

#. Ventilated patients should all have a daily ICU “Bundle” of best
   practices. See Addendum 1 for a proposed“COVID-19 ICU Bundle”

3. Ventilator consults:

#. If you need additional assistance managing ventilator choices, you
   can request a pulmonary phone/in-person consult (pager 11957)

7. .. rubric:: Managing Ventilation
      :name: h.qrh9t96165ug

#. Follow ARDSnet ventilation where possible: 

#. Tidal volumes should be 4-6 cc/kg using IBW (see table above) to
   minimize volumes (and thus ventilator injury)

2. Minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume) typically drives
   pH and PC02:

#. Titrate ventilatory parameters to pH, not PCO2
#. To achieve low tidal volumes, we tolerate hypercapnia (functionally
   no limitation unless clinical sequelae) and acidemia (pH > 7.2)
#. Because tidal volumes are low, the respiratory rate often has to be
   high to accommodate; typical RR is 20-35 breaths/minute

3. pH goal is normally 7.25-7.45:

#. If pH > 7.45, decrease respiratory rate
#. If pH 7.15-7.30, then increase respiratory rate until pH > 7.30, or
   PaCO2 < 25 (maximum RR= 35 breaths/minute)
#. If pH < 7.15, then increase respiratory rate to 35 breaths/minute
#. If pH still < 7.15, then perform the following:

#. Tidal volume may be increased by 1 mL/kg until pH > 7.15 (until
   plateau pressure reaches 30 cm H2O or tidal volume reaches 8 cc/kg)
#. Deep sedation advancing to RASS -5 if needed
#. If no improvement, initiate continuous paralysis
#. If still no improvement, initiate prone ventilation (may improve V/Q
   matching and better ventilation)

8. .. rubric:: Managing Oxygenation
      :name: h.4wvmhdtgo9di

#. Minimizing oxygen toxicity:

#. PEEP and Fi02 drive oxygenation
#. The goal is to deliver a partial pressure of oxygen to perfuse
   tissues (PaO2 > 75, Sp02 >92%) while limiting lung injury from high
   distending pressures (Ppl < 30) and hyperoxia (FiO2 < 95, SpO2 <
   96%).
#. Lower limit goals for PaO2 / SpO2 are widely debated (and discuss
   inRationale); PaO2 > 65 and SpO2 >89% is also commonly used at BWH.

2. PEEP management:

#. Initial PEEP should be set as explained in section 4 above.
#. If patient is hypoxic on Vt = 6 ml/kg and ideal PEEP from PV tool (or
   PEEP determination from ARDSnet table for non-Hamilton G5
   ventilators), perform the following:

#. Deep sedation, advancing to RASS -5 if needed; if no improvement
   then:
#. Initiate continuous paralysis (cisatracurium bolus 0.2mg/kg followed
   by infusion at 0-5 mcg/kg/min titrated to patient-ventilator
   synchrony); if no improvement then:
#. Initiate prone ventilation (see below); high consideration for
   useearly in severe ARDS (<36 hours from ARDS onset, start discussion
   of proning when P:F < 150, prone within 12 hours of FiO2 > 75%)

3. Checking plateau pressure:

#. Check plateau pressure with every change in tidal volume, PEEP, or
   clinical deterioration (worsening oxygenation) but not as part of
   routine practice

#. If plateau pressure is > 30 cm H20, then decrease tidal volume by 1
   ml/kg (minimum 4 mL/kg)
#. If plateau pressure is < 25 H20 and tidal volume < 6 mL/kg, then
   increase tidal volume by 1 mL/kg until plateau pressure is > 25 cm
   H2O or tidal volume = 6 mL/kg
#. If plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20 and patient is breath stacking or
   dys-synchronous, then increase tidal volume in mL/kg increments to 7
   mL/kg or 8 mL/kg so long as plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20

4. Adjusting Fi02:

#. Adjust Fi02 after optimizing PEEP  
#. Goal FiO2 < 75%; if FiO2 > 75%; patient requires ventilator
   optimization. If you need assistance, pulmonary consultation is
   available (pager 11957)
#. It is reasonable to put a desaturating patient temporarily on 100%
   Fi02, but remember to wean oxygen as rapidly as possible

5. Rationale:

#. Avoiding hyperoxia:Extensive mammalian animal data demonstrates that
   hyperoxic injury occurs at an FiO2 ≥ 75% (at sea level) with the rate
   of injury increasing as FiO2 exceeds that threshold. In multiple
   mammalian models, an FiO2 of 100% for 48 to 72 hours is associated
   with nearly 100% mortality rate. In lung injury models, the time to
   death is markedly attenuated. In an effort to reduce the potential
   for hyperoxic injury, the threshold of FiO2 ≥ 75% triggers
   progressive intervention throughout this protocol: increased
   sedation, paralysis, proning and ECMO consultation. For a review of
   hyperoxic acute lung injury, see Kallet and Matthay,Respir Care,
   2013. 
#. Setting the lower oxygen limits:There is debate on the proper PaO2
   goal, and our rationale relies on evidence for lack of benefit from
   conservative PaO2 goals in clinical trials (i.e., PaO2 > 55) and past
   association between lower PaO2 and cognitive impairment, although the
   evidence is certainly not definitive (mean PaO2 71 [IQR 67-80] for
   cognitively impaired survivors versus mean PaO2 86 [IQR, 70-98] in
   non-impaired survivors of ARDS (Mikkelsenet al.,Am J Respir Crit Care
   Med.2012\ `[c] <#cmnt3>`__\ ). In the LOCO2 multi-center, randomized
   clinical trial, patients with ARDS were randomized to their PaO2
   55-70, SpO2 88-92%; or PaO2 90-105, SpO2 >95%); the trial was stopped
   after enrollment of 205 patients due to futility and safety concerns
   (44% mortality in conservative oxygen group versus 30%; (Barrotet
   al.,New Eng J Med,2020\ `[d] <#cmnt4>`__\ ).

9. .. rubric:: Proning and Pulmonary Vasodilators
      :name: h.wgrateeto9z4

#. Prone early:

#. We recommendearly proning in severe ARDS without vasodilator trial (a
   depature from our typical practice for ARDS not due to COVID-19): <36
   hours from ARDS onset, start discussion of prone when P:F < 150,
   prone within 12 hours of FiO2 > 75% (Guérin,N Engl J Med,2013). 

2. Eligibility criteria for proning:

#. Eligibility may vary depending on resources and staffing. Currently
   we recommend:

#. Age < 75
#. No high grade shock (either single agent norepinephrine20 mcg/min or
   norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min and vasopressin)
#. Not on CRRT or at risk of impending renal failure (due to
   difficulties in maintaining dialysis access while proned)
#. The only absolute contraindications to proned ventilation are spinal
   cord injury and open chest; BMI and patient size are not
   contraindications

3. To initiate prone ventilation outside of MICU and 11C:

#. Discuss with the PCCM Consultation team assigned to that unit
#. ICU charge nurse to contact MICU charge nurse for nursing assistance

4. Managing a proned patient:

#. Proning protocol is available at the MICU sharepoint
#. Maintain deep sedation with target RASS -4 to -5 while proned
#. 1 hour post-initiation of prone ventilation:

#. Adjust oxygen parameters: re-assess lung mechanics (plateau pressure
   and P-V tool to determine optimal PEEP) and adjust PEEP and titrate
   FiO2 as in “Managing Ventilation” (section 7)
#. Assess tidal volume and adjust ventilation parameters as in section 6

#. If Vt < 6 ml/kg, may increase to maximum limit of 8 ml/kg while Ppl <
   30

4. If patient demonstrates improvement on proning then recommend:

#. Discontinuing of continuous neuromuscular blockade and re-assess
   ventilator dyssynchrony; re-institute if dyssynchronous
#. Return to supine ventilation when following criteria are met:

#. Ppl < 25
#. FiO2 < 50
#. pH > 7.3
#. P:F > 200

5. Repositioning and skin care while proned:

#. Currently we recommend continuing proning as per the MICU proning
   protocol. This may change in the future depending on availability of
   PPE and staffing.

5. Escalation if still hypoxic:

#. If hypoxia (PaO2 < 55 with FiO2 > 75) persists after proning; then
   initiate continuous inhaled epoprostenol (see “COVID-19 Therapies and
   Clinical Trials” section)
#. If FiO2 > 75% despite above, recommend consultation with ECMO team
   (see below)

 

10. .. rubric:: ECMO consultation
       :name: h.24j39tc7pjup

#. Refractory Hypoxemia:

#. If despite PEEP optimization, paralysis, prone ventilation,
   optimizing volume status, pulmonary vasodilators (when available) the
   patient meets the following criteria, then consider ECMO consult
   (pager 35010)

#. Ppl > 30
#. FiO2 > 75%
#. P:F < 80

2. Candidacy:

#. Final ECMO guidelines for COVID-19 patients remainunder
   development\ `[e] <#cmnt5>`__\ . Examples of common considerations
   include:

#. Patient age < 65
#. Mechanical ventilation duration < 7 days
#. BMI < 35 and patient body weight < 150 kg
#. CrCl > 30
#. No multiorgan failure or high grade shock (can be on single pressor;
   norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min)
#. No active solid or liquid malignancy
#. Absolute neutrophil count > 500
#. Platelets > 50,000
#. Able to tolerate anticoagulation on initiation (no active hemorrhage)
#. No evidence of irreversible neurological injury
#. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

Chapter 3: COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials
=================================================

Note:The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory section below written by our
critical care group is meant to provide a summary of the literature.
This section does not represent the views or recommendations of the BWH
Div. of Infectious Disease. The separate BWH Infectious Disease
guidelines and ID consultation service take precedence over the
information from the literature below.

#. .. rubric:: Clinical trials
      :name: h.szvkuh7mguyn

#. Consult Infectious Disease for:

#. Patients with +COVID-19 PCR; and clinical history and any chest
   imaging suspicious for COVID-19
#. Re-consult if the patient develops ARDS (mechanically ventilated with
   P/F ratio < 300) or shock/cytokine syndrome

2. Current trials:

#. ID teams are enrolling for clinical trials of Remdesivir and possibly
   other antiviral agents
#. ID and the PETAL network are coordinating to enroll for clinical
   trials of host-response modifying therapies (see  “Systemic
   Corticosteroids” and “Anti-IL6 agents” subsections of this chapter)

3. Monitor for drug-drug interactions:

#. Patients may arrive at the ICU already enrolled in a COVID19 clinical
   trial.  Verify that ICU treatment regimen does not add harmful drug
   interactions with study agents

2. .. rubric:: Antibiotic stewardship
      :name: h.8vhrbtln428m

#. Antibiotic choice:

#. Antibiotics should reflect IDSA guidelines, presumed source, and MDRO
   risk. For a presumed pulmonary source:

#. Without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. living in
   community, no prior MDROs):

#. Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin  

2. With risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas (i.e. chronic
   hospitalization, prior MDR infections):

#. Vancomycin+ Cefepime, and consider Ciprofloxacin if high concern for
   Pseudomonas

3. See special dispensations for oncology patients in chapter 7

2. Formulation:

#. Give oral antibiotics (Azithromycin, Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin)
   when possible to reduce volume load, unless concerns for poor oral
   absorption

3. Coinfection:

#. If concurrent influenza give Oseltamivir
#. Given lymphopenia consider Pneumocystis and treat accordingly

4. Discontinuation:

#. Antibiotics should be discontinued as soon as possible (within 48h)
   if:

#. Clinical status is not deteriorating, cultures do not reveal
   pathogens at 48h, and procalcitonin and WBC are relatively stable
   from 0 to 48h

#. Clinical judgement should prevail over any specific lab value

5. Rationale:Clinical reports indicate that rates of bacterial
   superinfection of COVID19 are low (10-20%), but when present increase
   mortality risk. Anecdotal reports suggest less MRSA superinfection
   than with influenza. Unnecessary antibiotics carry risks of fluid
   overload and drug-resistance, as well as the possibility that
   antibiotics may become a limited resource. (Zhou et al.,Lancet, 2020;
   Yang et al.,Lancet, 2020; Lippi and Plebani,Clinica Chimica
   Acta, 2020; WHO,COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020)

 

3. .. rubric:: Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) vs.nebulizers
      :name: h.eudti5z0ojjo

#. Non-intubated patients:

#. For COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI, use MDI (inhalers), not nebulizers,
   due to the increased aerosol risk.
#. Because MDI supply is limited, only prescribe when needed.  
#. For non-COVID-19 Confirmed or PUI patient, use nebulizers even if on
   droplet precautions (e.g., influenza) because MDI supply is limited.
#. After a patient is COVID-neg (and no longer on COVID precautions per
   infection control): After the patient’s current MDI runs out, switch
   to neb.

2. Intubated patients: 

#. The ventilator circuit is a closed system so nebulizers can be used
   when required (e.g.,DuoNeb standing and albuterol PRN).

3. Rationale: Nebulization may aerosolize viral particles and contribute
   to disease transmission.  COVID-19 clinical reports do not indicate
   wheeze as a common symptom, and not all patients require
   bronchodilators (Zhou et al,Lancet, 2020; Yang et al,Lancet, 2020;
   Guan et al,N Engl J Med, 2020; WHO,COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020)

4. .. rubric:: Airway Clearance  
      :name: h.8pktimpr5u6o

#. Management principles:

#. Reports from Wuhan and Italy indicate that some patients develop very
   thick secretions causing dangerous mucus plugging. However,
   nebulizers and airway clearance techniques may aerosolize secretions
#. Airway clearance should be used only inselected ventilated
   patients (closed circuit) with extremely thick secretions to avoid
   mucus plugging that would require bronchoscopy

2. For thinning secretions:

#. Anecdotal reports suggest Dornase alfa may be particularly effective
   in thinning secretions in COVID19 patients. However, data for Dornase
   alfa in non-CF patients is poor. For now we
   recommend:\ `[f] <#cmnt6>`__

#. Consideration ofDornase alfa 2.5mg nebulizer once daily

#. Can cause bronchoconstriction and mucosal bleeding
#. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg, just prior to delivery
#. Avoid in setting of bloody secretions

2. Alternative: Nebulizedhypertonic (3-7%) saline once daily

#. Side effects can include bronchoconstriction

#. Start with 3% to assess response and bronchoconstriction
#. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg just prior to delivery

3. Avoid N-acetylcysteine due to frequent dosing requirements

3. Airway clearance:  

#. Continue chest PT vests if patient uses at home (e.g. CF patients)
   with appropriate isolation precautions. Bronchiectasis patients may
   be considered on a case-by-case basis
#. Avoid oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (Aerobika or
   Acapella) and cough assist (MIE)

5. .. rubric:: Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators
      :name: h.ym3ao1e1uli3

#. Indications for use:

#. Inhaled vasodilators should not be routinely used except in two
   circumstances

#. As a rescue strategy in already prone ventilated patients (see
   “Respiratory Support for COVID-19 Patients” section).

#. There is no evidence of survival benefit of inhaled vasodilators in
   ARDS, and there are risks of viral aerosolization when connecting the
   device  (Fuller et al.,Chest, 2015; Gebistorf et al.,Cochrane
   Database Syst Rev, 2016; Afshari et al,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,
   2017)

2. To reduce RV afterload in hemodynamically significant RV failure in
   consultation with cardiology

2. Instructions for use:

#. If inhaled vasodilators are used, they should reevaluated at 4 hours
    

#. Inhaled Epoprostenol: 

#. Start continuous nebulization at 0.05mcg/kg/min based on IBW  

#. If no improvement in P/F ratio in 2 hours, wean off by decreasing
   0.01mcg/kg/min everyhour 

2. Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO):

#. Strong consideration in refractory ARDS that does not respond to
   inhaled epoprostenol. 

#. Limitedin vitro data notes that iNO at high doses inhibits
   replication of SARS-CoV, but this has not been studiedin vivo.
   (Akerstrom et al.,J Virol, 2005; Gebistorf et al.,Cochrane Database
   Syst Rev, 2016)
#. iNO may be included in future trial protocols, such as early
   initiation in milder disease (non-intubated).

6. .. rubric:: Systemic Corticosteroids
      :name: h.x05c129ivxrw

#. Data oncorticosteroids for COVID-19: 

#. Most studies show negative effects of corticosteroids on similar
   viruses

#. There is no clinical evidence of net benefit from steroids in
   SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infection, and observational data
   show increased mortality, more secondary infections, impaired viral
   clearance and more adverse effects in survivors (e.g. psychosis,
   diabetes, avascular necrosis). (Lee et al., J Clin Virol, 2004;
   Stockman et al.,PLoS Med, 2006; Arabi et al.,Am J Respir Crit Care
   Med, 2018; WHO,COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020; Wu et al.,JAMA Int
   Med, 2020)

2. However, a new retrospective cohort (201 patients, 84 [42%] of whom
   developed ARDS) demonstrated that among patients with ARDS,
   methylprednisolone decreased risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
   0.20-0.72) (Wu et al.,JAMA Int Med, 2020)

2. Recommendation:

#. We recommend against using steroids for COVID-19 except as part of a
   clinical trial

#. This is in line with WHO Guidelines as of 3/13/2020

3.  Use corticosteroids if required for other indications:

#.  Use the lowest dose for the shortest duration:

#. Asthma or COPD exacerbation

#. 40mg prednisone PO or 30mg methylprednisolone IV, once daily x 3-5
   days

2. Shock with history of chronic steroid use > 10mg prednisone daily:

#. 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock

3. Multipressor shock without history of chronic steroid use

#. 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock

7. .. rubric:: Anti-IL6 Agents (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab)  
      :name: h.m6l0vgre9d0s

#. Pathophysiology:

#. IL-6 activates T cells and macrophages, among other cell types (see
   “Cytokine Activation Syndrome”

#. IL-6 inhibitors are approved for cytokine activation syndrome
   complications related to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T)
   therapy (Brudno & Kochenderfer,Blood Rev, 2019;Rubin et
   al,Brain, 2019)
#.  IL-6 levels are reported to correlate with severe COVID-19
#. While patients have peripheral lymphopenia, BAL fluid is often
   lymphocytic, suggesting that IL-6 inhibition and prevention of T cell
   activation may be protective

2. Recommendation:

#. We do not recommend routine use at this time

#. There are anecdotal reports of benefit of tocilizumab in COVID19
   patients but no rigorous studies are available (Anecdotal reports
   from Italy; Chinese National Health Commission Clinical Guideline,
   March 3, 2020.)

2. For severecytokine activation syndrome cases (see Chapter 7, “Other
   Guidance”):

#. Consult Infectious Disease team for enrollment in a clinical trial
   based on CRP and IL-6 levels.

#. Exercise caution ifsecondary infection is clinically suspected -
   including sepsis, pneumocystis or bacterial pneumonia

3. Dosing regimens:

#. Tocilizumab 4-8mg/kg (suggested dose 400mg) IV x1 (anti-IL6R mAb)

#. Dose can be repeated 12h later if inadequate response to first dose.
    Total dose should be no more than 800mg. Tocilizumab should not be
   administered more than twice.
#. Common adverse effects include:

#. Transaminitis (AST, ALT) > 22%
#. Infusion reaction 4-20%
#. Hypercholesterolemia 20%
#. Upper respiratory tract infection 7%
#. Neutropenia 2-7%

2. Alternative: Siltuximab 11mg/kg IV x1 (anti-IL6 mAb)

#. Common adverse effects include:

#. Edema >26%
#. Upper respiratory infection >26%
#. Pruritis / skin rash 28%
#. Hyperuricemia 11%
#. Lower respiratory tract infection 8%
#. Thrombocytopenia 8%
#. Hypotension 4%

8. .. rubric:: Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine
      :name: h.wr1agkjgho7b

#. Pathophysiology:

#. Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial 4-aminoquinoline shown to have
   in vitro (but not yet in-vivo) activity against diverse RNA viruses
   including SARS-CoV-1 (Touret et al,Antivir Res, 2020).
#. It is thought to act through multiple mechanisms. (Devaux et al,Int J
   Antimicrob Agent, 2020)

#. Inhibition of viral entry. HQ inhibits synthesis of sialic acids and
   interferes with protein glycosylation, which may disrupt interactions
   necessary for viral attachment and entry. (Vincent et al,Virol J,
   2005). (Olofsson et al,Lancet Infect Dis, 2005).
#. Inhibition of viral release into the host cell. HQ blocks endosomal
   acidification, which activates endosomal proteases. These proteases
   are required to initiate coronavirus/endosome fusion that releases
   viral particles into the cell. (Yang ZY et al,J Virol2004)
#. Reduction of viral infectivity. HQ has been shown to inhibit protein
   glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of viral proteins. Studies
   on other RNA viruses have shown a resulting accumulation of
   non-infective viral particles, or an inability of viral particles to
   bud out of the host cell (Savarino et al,J AIDS, 1996; Klumperman et
   al,J Virol, 1994)
#. Immune modulation. HQ reduces toll-like receptor and cGAS-STING
   signaling. It has been shown to reduce release of a number of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines from several immune cell types
   (Schrezenmeier and Dorner,Nat Rev Rheum, 2020)

2. Data:

#. Anexpert consensus group out of Chinasuggests that
   Chloroquineimproved lung imaging and shortened disease course.
   (Zhonghua et al.,CMAPH, 2020). Chloroquine will be included in the
   next treatment guidelines from the National Health Commission, but
   the specific data on which this is based is not available yet. (Gao
   et al.,Biosci Trends, 2020)
#. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in
   inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Yao et al.,Clin Infect Dis, 2020)

3. Recommendation:

#. Strong consideration of hydroxychloroquine in patients who require
   supplemental oxygen who are not candidates for other clinical trials.

4. Dosing(from the literature):

#. Hydroxychloroquine:

#. 400mg PO BID on the first day,followed by 200mgq12 (q8h  if concerns
   for absorption) for 5-10 days

2. Chloroquine (not available at BWH):

#. Second line agent (increased toxicity compared to Hydroxychloroquine)
#. 500mg Chloroquine phosphate 500mg PO bid for 10 days

#. Common adverse reactions include:

#. Prolonged QT interval and risk of Torsade de pointes
#. Cardiomyopathy
#. Bone marrow suppression

2. Contraindicated in epilepsy and porphyria

9. .. rubric:: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I)
      andAngiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)
      :name: h.uebugzw0ifj

#. Pathophysiology:

#. The role of ACE-I/ARBs in the treatment or pathogenesis of renal
   failure in COVID-19 confirmed patients is paradoxical and
   inadequately understood at this time

#. COVID-19 enters the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV: angiotensin
   converting enzyme II (ACE2) (Zhou et al., Nature, 2020). COVID-19 is
   thought to have 10-20x higher affinity to ACE2 than SARS
#. In addition to the kidneys, ACE2 is expressed in the heart, lungs,
   and vasculature.  This has led to the hypothesis that ACE-I and ARBs,
   which increase the levels of ACE2, might worsen myocarditis or ACS
#. However,ACE2 has been shown to have aprotective effect against
   virus-induced lung injury by increasingangiotensin\ `[g] <#cmnt7>`__

2. Recommendation:

#. Foroutpatients:

#. We recommendagainst discontinuing outpatient ACE-I/ARBs

#. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and
   Heart Failure Society of America joint statement
   recommendsagainst discontinuing ACE-I and ARBs in patients with
   COVID-19 (Bozkurt et al., HFSA/ACC/AHA Statement Addresses Concerns
   Re: Using RAAS Antagonists in COVID-19,2020)

2. Forinpatients:

#. We recommend strong consideration ofdiscontinuing and avoiding
   ACE-I/ARBs in inpatients given the risk of kidney injury in severe
   illness (see Chapter 7, “Other Guidance”)

10. .. rubric:: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
       :name: h.msot2gdaj2bg

#. Pathophysiology:

#. SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via ACE2. ACE2 is upregulated by ibuprofen
   in animal models, and this might contribute (see “Angiotensin
   Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor
   Blockers (ARB)” section)

2. Recommendation:

#. Use Acetaminophen instead of NSAIDs wherever possible

#. WHO recommends avoiding NSAIDs as of 3/18/20. There is a paucity of
   evidence, though WHO suggests this is best practicebased on case
   reports of sudden deaths in France. To date, there are no published
   human studies to support this hypothesis.(WHO,COVID-19 Guidelines,
   2020; Fang et al.,Lancet Respir Med, 2020; Day,BMJ, 2020)

2. Risk/benefit should be considered in select circumstances (e.g.
   pericarditis)

11. .. rubric:: Blood Products 
       :name: h.p7atxkt2b3sh

#. Recommendation:

#. Restrictive transfusion strategy (Hct > 21, Hgb > 7) is recommended
   unless the patient is actively bleeding or there is concern for acute
   coronary syndrome

#. Parsimony is encouraged given limited supplies (blood drives are
   limited by social distancing)
#. Acute coronarysyndrome: Hgb > 10
#. Oncology patients: if possible, reduce threshold to Hgb >7
#. All others: Hgb > 7
#. Massive transfusion protocol, as a very limited resource, will need
   to be activated only by the ICU attending 

2. Other blood products:

#. Treat bleeding not numbers
#. FFP or 4 factor-PCC (lower volume) for active bleeding in setting of
   known or suspected coagulation abnormalities
#. Warfarin reversal: use 4 factor-PCC given longer effect and lower
   volume
#. Platelets: goal > 30K unless actively bleeding

2. Rationale: Volume overload is of particular concern in patients with
   COVID-19 so transfusions may be harmful. Randomized controlled trials
   of ICU patients have shown that a conservative transfusion strategy
   (Hgb 7) is associated with less pulmonary edema, fewer cardiac
   events, fewer transfusions (likely fewer transfusion reactions) and
   no evidence of harm compared to a liberal transfusion strategy.

Chapter 4: Cardiac Complications of COVID-19
============================================

#. .. rubric:: Acute Cardiac Injury
      :name: h.sxzvrsrmkd1g

#. Definition:

#. Defined as troponin > 99th percentile, or abnormal EKG or
   echocardiographic findings

2. Incidence:

#. Incidence of 7-22% in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China
   (Ruan et al.,Intensive Care Med, 2020; Wang et al.,JAMA, 2020; Chen
   et al.,Lancet, 2020)  

3. Prognostic implications:

#. ACI is higher in non-survivors (59%, n=32) than survivors (1%, n=1)
   (Zhou,Lancet, 2020)
#. ACI is higher in ICU patients (22%, n=22) compared to non-ICU
   patients (2%, n=2) (Wang, JAMA, 2020)

4. Time course:

#. Troponin rise and acute cardiac injury tend to be late manifestations

#. Troponin increased rapidly from ~14 days from illness onset, after
   the onset of respiratory failure. (Zhou et
   al.,Lancet, 2020)\ `[h] <#cmnt8>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[i] <#cmnt9>`__
#. Among non-survivors, a steady rise in troponin I levels was observed
   throughout the disease course from day 4 of illness through day 22
   (Zhou et al.,Lancet, 2020)

5. Mechanism:

#. The mechanism is unknown, though several have been proposed, based on
   very limited data outside of case reports (Zeng et al.,Preprints,
   2020)

#. Possible direct toxicity through viral invasion into cardiac myocytes
   (i.e. myocarditis), though direct myocardial viral infiltration does
   not seem to have been found in specimens obtained at biopsy (American
   College of Cardiology,  Cardiologist’s Insights From Treating
   COVID-19 Patients in China, 2020)
#. Acute coronary syndrome and demand ischemia
#. Stress Cardiomyopathy (i.e. Takotsubo’s)

2. .. rubric:: Cardiovascular Testing
      :name: h.es6b8f4xqski

#. Troponin:

#. ICU patients: Check hsTrop daily and SCvO2 daily
#. Inpatients: Check hsTrop every other day

#. If hsTrop > 200 ng/L or CvO2 < 60%

#. Obtain 12-lead ECG
#. Perform point-of-care US (POCUS) if you are trained to do so
#. If no new ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, continue to monitor
   daily hsTrop and CvO2

2. Telemetry:

#. Telemetry should be used for all critically-ill patients
#. In floor patients, telemetry should be used only in patients who
   meet\ `AHA <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000527%23T7&sa=D&ust=1584714690188000>`__\ `criteria <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000527%23T7&sa=D&ust=1584714690188000>`__\ `[j] <#cmnt10>`__\ .
   It should not be used routinely for every COVID-19 admission

3. ECGs:

#. Daily ECGs are reasonable for individuals with severe COVID-19

#. When possible, print ECGs from the in-room monitor to minimize
   contamination of equipment

4. TTE:

#. Do not order routine TTEs on COVID-19 patients

#. Cardiology consult or a trained provider should perform POCUS if:

#. Troponin elevation or decline in SCV02/ MV02
#. Shock
#. New heart failure (not pre-existing heart failure)
#. New persistent arrhythmia
#. Significant ECG changes

2. If abnormalities are identified (e.g. new reduction in LV EF<50%), a
   formal TTE should be obtained and cardiology consulted

#. Where possible order limited TTEs instead of full TTEs to conserve
   resources

5. Stress Testing:

#. Stress testing is likely not indicated in individuals with active
   COVID.
#. Any question of possible stress testing should be directed to
   cardiology

3. .. rubric:: Arrhythmias
      :name: h.rm4wr985h2i8

#.  Incidence:

#. Case series report the occurrence of unspecified arrhythmias in 17%
   of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=23 of 138), with higher
   rate in ICU patients (44%, n=16) compared to non-ICU patients (7%,
   n=7) (Zhou et al.,Lancet, 2020).
#. There are anecdotal reports of VT and VF as a late manifestation of
   COVID-19. No specific published findings were identified

2. Workup:

#. Telemetry, 12-lead EKG, Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, TFT
#. SCVO2 if central line present (goal SCVO2 > 60%)
#. POCUS to assess LV and RV function

#. Obtain formal TTE if abnormalities of any of the above

3. Treatment:

#. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter

#. Beta blockade if no evidence of heart failure or shock

#. If significant heart failure or borderline BPs, use amiodarone.There
   is no known increased concern for amiodarone lung toxicity

2.  If unstable, synchronized DCCV with 100-200 Joules

2. Ventricular tachycardia orVT\ `[k] <#cmnt11>`__\  

#. Unstable/pulseless: initiate ACLS
#. Stable:

#. Cardiology consult (may represent evolving myocardial involvement)
#. Amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 or lidocaine 100mg IV x 1

4. .. rubric:: Acute Coronary Syndromes
      :name: h.13b1uhteftcc

#. Incidence:

#. There is no current available data on the incidence of ACS in COVID.
   However, we presume that due to the presence of ACE2 receptors on the
   endothelium, and the known increased risk of ACS in influenza that
   there is likely an increased incidence of ACS among COVID-19
   patients.

#. The incidence of ACS is about 6 times as high within seven days of an
   influenza diagnosis than during control interval - incidence ratio
   6.05 (95% CI, 3.86 to 9.50).(Kwong et al.,NEJM,
   2018)\ `[l] <#cmnt12>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[m] <#cmnt13>`__

2. Workup:

#. Elevated troponin/ECG changes alone may not be able to discriminate
   between:

#. Coronary thrombosis
#. Demand-related ischemia
#. Myocarditis

2. Determination of ACS will rely on all evidence available:

#. Symptoms (if able to communicate)

#. New dyspnea, chest pain, anginal equivalents

2. Regional ECG changes
3. Rate of change of Troponin changes (i.e. acute rise suggests ACS)
4. Echo findings (e.g. new RWMA)

3. When in doubt, request a cardiology consult

3. Management:

#. Medical management of ACS should be coordinated with cardiology

#. Treat with full dose aspirin, clopidogrel (if not bleeding), heparin,
   oxygen (if hypoxemic), statin, nitrates (if hypertensive), and
   opioids (if persistent pain during medical management)

#. Beta blockers should be used with caution given possible concomitant
   myocarditis/decompensated heart failure

2. As of the time of this writing, the cath lab will take COVID-19
   patients, even if ventilated

#. If resources become constrained and door-to-balloon time is no longer
   adequate, cardiology may decide to use lytic medications for COVID-19
   STEMI patients in lieu of PCI

5. .. rubric:: Pericarditis and Myocarditis
      :name: h.txp16938ptwl

#. Incidence:

#. Myocarditis and pericarditis may be potential manifestations of
   COVID-19 and source of Acute Cardiac Injury, based on case
   reports/case series (Ruan et al.,Intensive Care Med, 2020; Zeng et
   al.,Preprints, 2020; Hu et al.,Eur Heart J, 2020)
#. However, there is currently little evidence of proven pericarditis or
   myocarditis, either by biopsy or cMRI

2. Diagnosis:

#. Likely no role for endomyocardial biopsy
#. cMRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with a cardiology
   consult team

3. Management:

#. Supportive for heart failure and direct viral treatments
#. The use of anti-inflammatory medications such as Colchicine and
   Ibuprofen should also be discussed with the cardiology consult team
   as this is evolving

.. _h.dpe5gr1hwjp:

Chapter 5: Shock: Septic, Cardiogenic, and Cytokine Storm
=========================================================

#. .. rubric:: Undifferentiated Shock in COVID
      :name: h.bdbn9kepy2bs

#. Definition:

#. Acute onset of new and sustained hypotension (MAP < 65 or SBP < 90)
   with signs of hypoperfusion requiring IVF or vasopressors to maintain
   adequate blood pressure

2. Time course:

#. Patients rarely present in shock on admission 

#. Natural history seems to favor the development of shock after
   multiple days of critical illness.

3. Etiology:

#. The range of reasons for shock is wide and more variable than for
   most patients and includes:

#. Cardiogenic shock
#. Secondary bacterial infection
#. Cytokine storm

4. Workup for newundifferentiated shock:

#. Assess for severity of end organ damage:

#. UOP,  Mental status, Lactate, BUN/creatinine, electrolytes, LFTs

2. Obtain a FULL infectious workup, which includes all of the following:

#. Labs:CBC with differential.Note that most COVID patients are
   lymphopenic (83%).  However, new leukocytosis can occur and
   left-shift can be used as a part of clinical picture (Guan et al,N
   Engl J Med, 2020).Two sets of blood cultures, LFTs (for
   cholangitis/acalculous cholecystitis), urinalysis (with reflex to
   culture), sputum culture (if safely obtained via inline suctioning,
   do not perform bronchoscopy or sputum induction), procalcitonin at 0
   and 48h (do not withhold early antibiotics on the basis of
   procalcitonin),urine Strep and legionella antigens
#. Portable CXR (avoid CT unless absolutely necessary)
#. Full skin exam

3. Assess for cardiogenic shock

#. Assess extremities: warm or cool on exam
#. Assess patient volume status: JVP, CVP, edema, CXR
#. Assess pulse pressure: If < 25% of the SBP, correlates highly with a
   reduction in cardiac index to less than 2.2 with a sensitivity of 91%
   and a specificity of 83% (Stevenson and Perloff,JAMA, 1989)
#. Perform POCUS if trained to do so

#. For TTE protocols see Chapter 4, “Cardiac Complications of COVID-19”

5. Labs: Obtain an SCV02 or MV02 if the patient has central access,
   troponin x2, NT proBNP, A1c, lipid profile, TSH
6. EKG (and telemetry)
7. Calculate estimated Fick Cardiac Output

#. CO (Cardiac Output), L/min = VO2/ [(SaO2 - SvO2) x Hb x 13.4)],

#. where VO2 = 125 mL O2/min
   x\ `BSA, <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mdcalc.com/body-mass-index-bmi-body-surface-area-bsa&sa=D&ust=1584714690198000>`__\  whereBSA
   = [(Height, cm x Weight, kg)/ 3,600 ]½; in patients aged ≥70, use 110
   mL O2x BSA for VO2

4. Assess for other causes of shock:

#. Vasoplegia:

#. Run medication list for recent cardiosuppressive medications,
   vasodilatory agents, antihypertensives

2. Adrenal insufficiency:

#. Unless high pretest probability of adrenal insufficiency, we
   recommend against routine cortisone stimulation testing

3. Obstruction:

#. PE (given the elevated risk of thrombosis)
#. Tamponade (given elevated risk of pericarditis)
#. Obstruction from PEEP

4. Cytokine storm (see “Cytokine Storm” section below)
5. Allergic reactions to recent medications
6. Neurogenic shock is uncommon in this context
7. Hypovolemia:

#. Bleeding
#. Insensible losses from fever
#. Diarrhea/vomiting

3. .. rubric:: Septic Shock and Secondary Infections
      :name: h.lydcfzsuv4hc

#. Incidence:

#. The reported rates of sepsis and septic shock are not reported
   consistently in currently available case series

#. Secondary bacterial infections are reported:

#. 20% of non-survivors (Zhou et al,Lancet, 2020)
#. 16% of non-survivors (Ruan et al,Intensive Care Med, 2020)
#. 12-19% In H1N1 epidemic (MacIntyre,BMC Infect Dis, 2018)

2. Concurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in at least one
   case (possibly due to lymphopenia)

2. Antibiosis:

#. Early empiric antibiotics should be initiated within 1 hour (see
   Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” “Antibiotic
   Stewardship” section)

3. Conservative Fluid Management:

#. Goal MAP > 65mmHg
#. Start Norepinephrine while determining the etiology of
   undifferentiated shock
#. We do not recommend conventional 30cc/kg resuscitation

#. Give 250-500cc IVF and assess in 15-30 minutes for:

#. Increase > 2 in CVP
#. Increase in MAP or decrease in pressor requirement

#. Use isotonic crystalloids; Lactated Ringer’s solution is preferred
   where possible. Avoid hypotonic fluids, starches, or colloids

2. Repeat 250-500cc IVF boluses; Use dynamic measures of fluid
   responsiveness

#. Pulse Pressure Variation: can be calculated in mechanicallyventilated
   patients without arrhythmia; PPV >12% is sensitive and specific for
   volume responsiveness
#. Straight Leg Raise: raise legs to 45° w/ supine torso for at least
   one minute. A change in pulse pressure of > 12% has sensitivity of
   60% & specificity of 85% for fluid responsiveness in mechanically
   ventilated patients; less accurate if spontaneously breathing
#. Ultrasound evaluation of IVC collapsibility should only be undertaken
   by trained personnel to avoid contamination of ultrasound

3. For further guidance,Conservative Fluid Management protocols are
   available from
   from\ `FACCT <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463&sa=D&ust=1584714690211000>`__\ ` Lite
   trial <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463&sa=D&ust=1584714690211000>`__\ (Grissom
   et al, Crit Care Med, 2015)
4. Rationale: COVID-19 clinical reports indicate the majority of
   patients present with respiratory failure without shock. ARDS is
   mediated in part by pulmonary capillary leak, and randomized
   controlled trials of ARDS indicate that a conservative fluid strategy
   is protective in this setting. (Grissom et al, Crit Care Med, 2015;
   Famous et al.,Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2017; Silversides et al.,Int
   Care Med, 2017; WHO,COVID-19 Guidelines, 2020)

4. Pressor management

#. Unless new evidence emerges, standard choices for distributive shock
   (i.e., norepinephrine then vasopressin) are recommended, with high
   vigilance for the development of cardiogenic shock, addressed in the
   next section.

5. Corticosteroids

#. See Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” section on
   “Systemic Corticosteroids”

#. Stress dose hydrocortisone should still be considered in patients on
   > 2 pressors 

4. .. rubric::  Cardiogenic Shock
      :name: h.ftupyxepmedz

6. Incidence:

#. Heart failure or cardiogenic shock was observed in 23% (n=44 of 191)
   of hospitalized patients in one case series

#. Higher rates in non-survivors (52%, n=28) compared to survivors (12%,
   n=16) (Zhou et al.,Lancet, 2020).  

2. Heart failure or myocardial damage contributed to death in 39% (n=29)
   of deaths in a series of 68 patients in Wuhan

#. Most (n=22 of 29) had concomitant respiratory failure (Ruan et al.,
    Intensive Care Med, 2020)

3. Anecdotally, our U.S. colleagues have not seen such high rates of
   heart failure

7. Diagnosis:

#. Significant concern for cardiogenic shock if any of the following are
   present with evidence of hypoperfusion (e.g. elevated lactate):

#. Elevated NT-ProBNP or
#. CvO2 < 60% (PvO2 < 35 mm Hg) or
#. Echo w depressed LV and/or RV function

8. Time course:

#. Cardiogenic shock may present late in the course of illness even
   after improvement of respiratory symptoms, and manifest as a
   precipitous clinical deterioration in the setting of an acute decline
   in LVEF (see section on “Acute Cardiac Injury”)

9. Etiology:

#. See section on “Acute Cardiac Injury; mechanism is unknown,
   potentially direct viral toxicity, ACS, or stress cardiomyopathy

10. Workup:

#. Rule out ACS and complete the initial work up as described in Chapter
   4
#. Ongoing monitoring:

#. Labs: Trend troponins to peak, SCvO2 (obtained by upper body CVC) or
   MvO2 q8-12h or with clinical change, Lactate q4-6h,  LFTs daily (for
   hepatic congestion)
#. Daily EKGs or prn with clinical deterioration
#. Trend troponin to peak

3. All cardiogenic shock cases require cardiovascular consult

#. PA Catheters may be placed bedside by experienced providers, with
   preference for use only in mixed shock or complex cases with
   cardiology guidance

11. Medical management:

#. Close collaboration with the cardiovascular consultation service is
   recommended
#. Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000,
   SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2

#. Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other
   parameters

3. How to achieve goals:

#. Continue titration of norepinephrine gtt for goal MAP 65-75
#. Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD > 25
#. Initiate inotropic support:

#. Dobutamine gtt for SCvO2 < 60%, CI < 2.2 and MAP > 65.  Start at
   2mcg/kg/min. Up-titrate by 1-2mcg/kg/min every 30-60 minutes for goal
   parameters. Alternative strategies should be considered once dose
   exceeds 5mcg/kg/min.  Maximum dose is 10mcg/kg/min

4. Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel
   blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued

12. Candidacy for Mechanical Support

#. The benefit of Mechanical Support in COVID-19 is not yet clear. In
   one study of patients with severe COVID-19, five (83%) of six
   patients receiving ECMO died (Yang et al.,Lancet,2020). There is
   concern that the further decrease of lymphocytes from ECMO could
   contribute to higher mortality. However, this is a very small study
   and more information is needed
#. Patients who experience the following should prompt an immediate call
   to the cardiovascular medicine consult service for consideration of
   mechanical support:

#. Dobutamine gtt at 5mcg/kg/min (or unable to tolerate dobutamine due
   to tachyarrhythmias) and SCVO2 < 60% or CI < 2.2
#. Lactate > 4 after medical therapy

3. The criteria for ECMO and other mechanical cardiovascular support
   varies among centers and are difficult to develop under typical
   circumstances. The unclear trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic makes
   these evaluations even more difficult. Please refer to the separate
   BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular Medicine guidelines which are in
   development.

The following does not reflect the recommendation of the BWH ECMO and
Cardiovascular services. However, for the purposes of general education,
ahypothetical set of inclusion criteria for ECMO or MCS could cover:

3.  Younger age
4.  Expected life expectancy >6 months pre-hospitalization
5.  No evidence of solid or liquid malignancy
6.  Able to tolerate anticoagulation
7.  Platelets >50,000
8.  Absence of severe peripheral arterial disease
9.  No evidence of irreversible neurological injury
10. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness
11. Cannot have profound respiratory failure (defined as requiring prone
    ventilation at time of consult for MCS or having PaO2:FiO2 ratio <
    150) (for MCS other thanECMO)

5. .. rubric::  Cytokine Activation Syndrome
      :name: h.7i62kagnynf0

#. Incidence:

#. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine storm
   syndrome and secondary HLH (Mehta et al., Lancet,2020). Patients who
   had cytokine storm developed rapid progression to ARDS, shock, and
   multiorgan failure (Chen et al., Lancet,2020)

2. Pathophysiology:

#. Neutrophil activation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of
   cytokine storm and ARDS (Wu, JAMA Intern Med,2020). Wu et al. found
   that COVID-19 confirmed patients with ARDS have higher neutrophil
   counts, average 7.04 (95% CI: 3.98 to 10.12) vs. those without ARDS,
   average 3.06 (2.03 to 5.56)
#. Similar patterns of cytokine storm and ARDS have been seen with SARS,
   MERS (Kim et al., J Korean Med Sci,2016)
#. Other studies have suggested that increased proinflammatory cytokines
   in the serum are associated with pulmonary injury in SARS, MERS, and
   COVID-19 (Wong et al., Clin Exp Immunol,2004)

3. Workup:

#. Suspect if clinical deterioration with shock and multiorgan failure
#. CBC with diff, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, ferritin, liver
   function test, triglycerides, c-reactive protein (CRP) (Ruan,
   Intensive Care Med,2020)

#. CRP seems to correlate with disease severity and prognosis of
   COVID-19 (Ruan, Intensive Care Med,2020;Young, JAMA,2020)
#. An\ `Hscore <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mdcalc.com/hscore-reactive-hemophagocytic-syndrome&sa=D&ust=1584714690218000>`__\  may
   be helpful in estimating the probability of secondary HLH in these
   patients 

4. Management:

#. If high suspicion, discuss with ID about the use of IVIG, steroids,
   cytokine blockade--particularly IL-6 pathway and perhaps IL-1 (see
   Chapter 3, “COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials,” section on
   “Anti-IL6 Agents”). While steroids have been implicated with worse
   lung injury and outcomes, they may be beneficial in the
   hyperinflammatory state

Chapter 6: Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations
====================================================

#. .. rubric:: Thrombotic Disease
      :name: h.9wzf9ick65rt

#. Incidence:

#. Unclear incidence, though case reports suggest there may be increased
   venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients(Xie et al.,Radiol:
   Cardiothoracic Imaging, 2020)

2. Pathophysiology:

#. The mechanism for VTE are unknown and likely multifactorial:

#. Systemic inflammatory response as seen in sepsis
#. Stasis/critical illness
#. Possibly direct endothelial damage from viral injury/ ACE2 binding

2. Colleagues from Wuhan have reported finding microthrombi in pulmonary
   vasculature on autopsy, (Luo W et al,Preprints 2020) which could
   contribute to local V/Q mismatch or hydrostatic changes causing
   edema. However these mechanisms remain entirely hypothetical
3. One theory: SARS-CoV requires coagulation Factor Xa for viral
   replication.  Factor Xa cleaves and activates protein S which is
   pro-thrombotic.  By extension, it is hypothesized that
   anticoagulation or anti-platelets might inhibit SARS-CoV-2
   replication. There is a small case series suggesting dipyrimadole may
   be useful, though anti-coagulation and anti-platelet agents requires
   further investigation prior to being used therapeutically(Liu et
   al.,medRxiv, 2020)

3. Management:

#. Initiate prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for all COVID-19
   patients unless otherwise contraindicated

#. If CrCl > 30: Lovenox 40 mg SC daily
#. If CrCl < 30 or AKI: Heparin 5000 units SC tid
#. Hold if Platelets <30,000 or bleeding, start TEDs and SCDs

2. If the patient is on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or Warfarin
   for Afib or VTE, switchto full dose anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH, as
   indicated based on renal function or clinical scenario)
3. While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in some
   severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan given the microthrombi in pulmonary
   vasculature (see above), our interpretation of the data is that the
   risks outweigh the benefits at this time, unless documented DVT or PE

4. Prognosis:

#. Higher D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ dysfunction
   syndrome and poorer prognosis.(Wang et al,JAMA2020, Zhou et
   al,Lancet 2020)

2. .. rubric:: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
      :name: h.vpg0k312hzmd

#. Incidence/pathophysiology:

#. Limited data: 16 of 183 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had DIC (Tang
   et al.,J Thromb
   Haemost, 2020\ `[n] <#cmnt14>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[o] <#cmnt15>`__\ ).
#. Laboratory changes in coagulation parameters and FDP track with
   multi-organ dysfunction (Zhou et al,Lancet 2020)

2. Time course:

#. Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into hospital admission (Tang
   et al.,J Thromb
   Haemost, 2020\ `[p] <#cmnt16>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[q] <#cmnt17>`__\ )

3. Workup:

#. Identify and treat underlying condition
#. `ISTH DIC score
   calculator <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reference.medscape.com/calculator/dic-score&sa=D&ust=1584714690222000>`__

#. If score < 5, no DIC; recalculate in 1-2 days

4. Management:

#. If bleeding, give blood products:

#. For elevated PT/PTT and bleeding, use FFP or 4F-PCC (KCentra - less
   volume, but must discuss dose with HAT/pharmacy)

2. If not bleeding, supportive care:

#. If fibrinogen < 150:FFP, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate
   (RiaSTAP)

#. RiaSTAP is less volume, but dose must be discussed with HAT/pharmacy

2. Transfuse platelets if < 30K

3. Hold
   anticoagulation\ `[r] <#cmnt18>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[s] <#cmnt19>`__\ for
   active bleeding.

#. Consider holding anticoagulation if patient requires blood products
   for supportive care, though clinician should weigh risks and benefits

4. Start anticoagulation only if:

#. Overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot (i.e. purpura
   fulminans)
#. Therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. UFH)

#. There has been no mortality benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation in
   DIC. (Levi et
   al.,Blood, 2018)\ `[t] <#cmnt20>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[u] <#cmnt21>`__

5. Prognosis:

#. DIC is associated with worse survival in COVID-19 patients. Out of
   183 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 71% of non-survivors had DIC (ISTH
   score ≥ 5) compared to 0.6% of survivors (Tang et al.,J Thromb
   Haemost, 2020\ `[v] <#cmnt22>`__\ :sup:`\ `\ `[w] <#cmnt23>`__\ )

.. _h.9jn4ulxubc3h:

Chapter 7: Renal Manifestations
===============================

#. .. rubric:: Acute Kidney Injury
      :name: h.fj20lj7bpd6o

#. Incidence:

#. Incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies widely, but estimates range from
   2.1% to 29%

2. Pathophysiology:

#. Likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from several mechanisms
   including:

#. Direct cellular injury by the virus via angiotensin converting enzyme
   II (ACE2). COVID-19 uses ACE2 for cell entry. ACE2 is expressed in
   proximal renal tubules more than glomeruli (Fan et al., Urology,2020)
#. Toxic ATN from cytokine storm
#. Shock and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to toxic/ischemic ATN
   (Xianghong et al., Natl Med J China,2020)

3. Workup:

#. Monitor Creatinine at least daily

#. Studies find variable onset of AKI, from 7 days (Cheng, Nephrology,
   preprint) to 15 days after illness onset (Zhou et al.,
   Lancet,2020). Onset of AKI more rapid and severe in patients with
   underlying CKD (Cheng, Nephrology,2020)  

2. If evidence of rising BUN and/or creatinine, order urinalysis 

#. Patients may present with proteinuria (44%), hematuria (26.9%)

4. Management:

#. Consult ICU nephrology early at the first sign of renal injury for
   all COVID-19 confirmed patients

#. Do not wait until need for RRT (renal replacement therapy)/dialysis
   for consultation.
#. At this time, all confirmed COVID-19 patients should be covered by
   ICU nephrology, not general nephrology

#. ICU
#. RRT Triage
#. Floor

2. Managing AKI:

#. Minimize nephrotoxic agents
#. Give judicious fluids for suspected prerenal insults, but discuss
   with renal if any ambiguity (see Chapter 5, “Shock” for conservative
   fluid recommendations)

5. Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT):

#. Estimates for RRT range from1 to 5% of hospitalized patients. Among
   critically ill patients, need for CRRT ranges from 5 to 23%

#. Few studies have reported outcomes of RRT. One case series reported
   that out of 191 patients, 10 received CRRT, and all 10 died (Zhou et
   al., Lancet,2020)

2. Renal will be coordinating RRT continuation and initiation

#. Indications for dialysis in COVID-19 patients are the same as the
   indications for all patients

3. ICU nephrology will determine the need, timing, and modality of renal
   replacement on a case-by-case basis

6. Prognosis:

#. Increased serum creatine, BUN, AKI, proteinuria, or hematuria are
   eachindependent risk factors for in-hospital death (Cheng et al.,
   Nephrology,2020) 
#. In two other studies, non-survivors had higher BUN and creatinine and
   higher rates of AKI (Wang et al., JAMA, 2020;Yang et al., Lancet
   Respir Med,2020)
#. Another study found that higher BUN and creatinine are associated
   with progression to ARDS, and higher BUN (though not creatinine) is
   associated with death (HR 1.06-1.20) (Wu et al., JAMA Int Med,2020)
#. In comparison, AKI was found in 6.7% of SARS patients. AKI correlated
   with poor prognosis and91.7% of patients with AKI died (vs 8.8%
   without AKI, p < 0.0001) (Chu et al., Kidney Int,2005)

.. _h.l3i6lcz3jr27:

Chapter 8: Other Guidance
=========================

#. .. rubric:: Liver Disease
      :name: h.fg1hqkm6u1r8

#. Incidence:

#. Up to 53% of patients had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
   aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Zhang et al., Lancet Gastroenterol
   Hepatol,2020)

2. Pathophysiology:

#. Possible mechanisms of liver injury include:

#. Direct viral infection of liver cells (2-10% of patients have
   diarrhea; COVID-19 found in stool samples)
#. Drug hepatotoxicity
#. Cytokine storm
#. Shock

3. Time course:

#. In general, liver injury in mild COVID-19 disease is transient and
   self-resolving. However, liver injury correlates with severity

#. ALT > 40 is associated with higher odds of in-hospital death (Zhou et
   al., Lancet,2020)
#. AST is associated with progression to ARDS but not death; total
   bilirubin is associated with both progression to ARDS and death (Wu
   et al., JAMA Intern Med,2020)

4. Monitoring:

#. Monitor LFTs every third day

#. If on hepatotoxic medications, monitor more frequently in conjunction
   with pharmacy
#. If starting Lopinavir/Ritonavir andChloroquine, monitor LFTs daily

2. Workup for other etiologies of liver injury with RUQUS, doppler
   ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, etc as clinically indicated

5. Management:

#. Consult GI/Hepatology if concern for acute liver failure (severe
   liver injury with elevated bilirubin, encephalopathy, and INR >1.5)
#. Run medication list for all possible offending agents and discontinue
   where possible
#. N-Acetyl-Cysteine is not recommended at this time due to significant
   volume load.Chinese studies refer to giving “liver protective drugs”
   in case of severe liver injury butwe recommend against this for now
#. There are no currentguidelines for treatment of COVID-19 patients
   with underlying cirrhosis, but societies such as AASLD are working on
   registries of these patients

2. .. rubric:: Considerations for Oncology Patients  
      :name: h.aayfijcxre19

#. Data:

#. As of 3/16/2020, there is no available published data specific to
   COVID19 management in oncologic or immunosuppressed patients

2. Oncology Consultation/Coverage:

#. For established DFCI patients, oncology consultation and guidance is
   provided by each patient’s primary oncologist (or coverage).

#. Contact primary oncologist via page not the general pager

3. Prognosis:

#. Many patients have reasonable or even good prognoses with current
   therapies. Do not assume a prognosis, involve outpatient attending

4. Meds:

#. Check in Epic medications tab and in “Research: Active” tab

5. Workup:

#. Labs:

#. Weekly glucan/galactomannan in neutropenic/transplant patients.
#. Specific patient populations may require additional monitoring (such
   as CMV, EBV monitoring in transplant patients – ask outpatient team).

2. Exam:

#. Examine catheters (port, CVC, others) daily.
#. Avoid rectal exams in neutropenic patients, but examine the
   perirectal area if symptoms or persistent fevers.
#. Do not give per rectum therapies to neutropenic patients.

6. Pain management:

#. Patients with cancer-related pain may have high opiate needs at
   baseline. Opiates should not be stopped but type may need to be
   adjusted in the setting of respiratory failure, renal injury, or
   liver injury.

#. Pain / Palliative Care service can help guide dose titrations in
   these situations.

7. Goals of Care:

#. Involve primary team whenever possible (recognizing that in
   critical/emergent situations may not be possible)

8. Anticoagulation:

#. Thrombosis prophylaxis should be initiated for all patients unless
   otherwise contraindicated, given that both COVID19 infection and
   malignancy increase thrombotic risk, particularly with solid tumors

#. See  “Thrombotic disease” for guidelines on both prophylactic and
   therapeutic anticoagulation
#. Remember to hold if Platelets <30,000

9. Patients with Heme Malignancy and Stem Cell Transplant:

#. Daily exam: Findings are more subtle or absent in neutropenic and
   immune suppressed patients. Examine catheters daily. Avoid rectal
   exam

10. Febrile Neutropenia:

#. Definition:

#. ANC < 500 cells/mm3 AND T ≥ 101F or T ≥ 100.5 for 1hr

2. Workup:

#. blood cultures from peripheral (ideally two sets), and each lumen of
   central line (label clearly); UA/sed with urine culture (UA may not
   be as informative with neutropenia); Glucan and galactomannan (if not
   checked recently), sputum if able, CXR

#. Continue DAILY blood cultures while febrile
#. Monitor serum galactomannan and 1-3-beta glucan once weekly
#. Any positive glucan or galactomannan prompts ID consult.

3. Initial Empiric Antibiotics:

#. GNRs: Ceftazidime -OR- Cefepime

#. Alternatives (2nd line) Piperacillin-tazobactam or (3rd line)
   meropenem

2. GPCs: add Vancomycin if hemodynamically unstable, or if MRSA
   pneumonia or catheter-associated infection is suspected. Check dosing
   with pharmacy if able

4. Removal of lines:

#. Catheter removal should be discussed if associated infection is
   suspected - involve primary oncologist and/or ID team to weigh risks
   and benefits, given that not all lines require removal.

5. Persistent Neutropenic Fever:

#. If fever persists x3 days despite antibiotics

#. Micafungin 100mg IV daily
#. Consideration of further imaging even if patient appears stable
   (discuss with oncology / ID)

6. Antiinfective course:

#. Antiinfectives should be continued until the patient has met all of
   these criteria:

#. (a) clinically improved and
#. (b) has been afebrile for 48h and
#. (c) has been non-neutropenic for 48h.

11. Transfusions:

#. Blood bank reivews order and will release appropriate product (i.e.
   irradiated, leukoreduced, etc)

#. RBC transfusion if Hgb < 7 or Hct < 21
#. Platelet transfusion if Platelets < 10K. Higher transfusion goals if
   needed for procedures or if active bleeding:

#. Plts > 20K if mild bleeding (i.e. epistaxis, line oozing) or if
   patient has rigors
#. Plts > 50K if more serious bleeding; may be higher for CNS bleeding
   or neurosurgery required

3. Cryoprecipitate transfusion if fibrinogen < 100
4. FFP transfusion if procedure needed. INR of FFP = ~1.4

12. Patients with Solid Tumors:

#. Patients with solid tumors are at very high risk of thrombosis but at
   lower risk of infection than most heme malignancy patients
#. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) do not significantly
   immunosuppress patients when used alone

#. Most common are CTLA4 inhibitor (ipilimumab) and PD-1/PD-L1
   inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab and
   avelumab).

3. Immune toxicity:

#. If patient develops organ dysfunction, it may be due to immune
   toxicity- consult the service team of the involved organ system and
   inform primary oncologist
#. Common immune toxicities include pneumonitis / respiratory failure
   (may be difficult to distinguish between COVID19 disease or may be
   aggravated by COVID19 infection), colitis, endocrine dysfunction
   (thyroid, pituitary / hypothalamic, adrenal), nephritis. Less common
   hepatitis, meningitis, dermatitis.

#. Check TSH, ACTH, cortisol, Tspot, HIV, HBV, HCV serologies if
   concerned

3. Immune toxicities are usually treated with high dose steroids - risks
   and benefits must be weighed immediately with primary oncologist and
   ID consult teams if immune toxicity is suspected concurrent with
   COVID19 infection.
4. `BWH/DFCI iTox

   be found on the DFCI intranet

3. .. rubric:: Goals of Care
      :name: h.t1khoickfgoo

#. Assess understanding and sign Health Care Proxy form on admission:

#. In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form
#. Make sure families are aware that patients with significant comorbid
   illnesses or who have poor baseline functional or health status
   decompensate rapidly and have very high mortality due to COVID-19
   (see Chapter 1, “Non-ICU Management, Triage, Transfers”)

2. Goals of Care should be documented and focus on:

#. A patient’s desired quality of life
#. Tolerance for/ desire for invasive measures
#. Understanding of disease process

4. .. rubric:: Management of Cardiac Arrest
      :name: h.ipfys4gecnv0

#. Early goals of care conversations are imperative

#.  The aim is to avoid unnecessary codes in patients without a
   reversible underlying condition

2. Health care workers should be protected in code situations:

#. PPE should be worn by all healthcare workers, even if donning
   prolongs time the patient spends a low-flow state during cardiac
   arrest
#. Codes should be run with an automated compression device where
   available and minimal personnel

3. Full code guidelines are forthcoming and will be included here when
   available

Afterword

Often, international societies convene a stellar committee of world
experts to craft clinical guidelines that define the field for years.

 

This is not that kind of guideline.

 

We built the first iteration of these guidelines “from the bottom up” in
less than a week. With the help of our readers, we expect to correct,
revise, add and subtract as we learn about COVID-19 with the help of our
patients.

 

The guideline making process

ADDENDUM: COVID ICU Bundle Checklist  
======================================

Rationale: Use of a daily checklist ensures that routine quality
measures are in place for each patient.  Review Bundle Checklist at the
end of each patient’s presentation, every day.  Each section should be
performed unless there is a contraindication or barrier to
implementation. If a contraindication is present, discuss how barriers
may be overcome.

Ventilator 

🗆 Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)

= turn off sedation

🗆 Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)

= Place patient on Pressure Support 5/5

- Perform SAT & SBT concurrently if able

- Contraindications to SAT/SBT include FiO2 > 50%, PEEP > 8, O2 sat <
90%, pH < 7.30, SBP < 90 or MAP < 60, paralysis, intracranial pressure
>15, concern for significant bleeding

🗆 If ARDS: goal Vt 6-8 cc/kg of ideal body weight (calculated by
height), plateau pressure < 30

🗆 Head of bed at >30 degrees

🗆 Oral care is ordered

Sedation / Delirium

🗆 Ask: Is patient delirious (CAM+)?

🗆 Review med list for any deliriogenic medications and
discontinue/change where possible

🗆 Define RASS goal

🗆 Record QTc daily, consider changing medications if QTc > 500

Restraints

🗆 Ask: Are restraints needed?

🗆 Sign necessary restraint orders

🗆 Discuss barriers to removing restraint orders

Mobility 

🗆 Consult PT for early mobility

- Contraindications include: deep sedation, paralysis

Pressure Ulcers

🗆 Ask: Are pressure ulcers present? Is a wound care consult needed?

🗆 Discuss whether any changes are needed to ulcer management plan

DVT prophylaxis

🗆 Review patient’s current DVT prophylaxis orders and adjust if needed

- Contraindications to LMWH DVT ppx include AKI (switch to UFH TID),
clinically significant bleeding (hold pharmacologic), platelet count <
30K (hold pharmacologic)

- Add sequential compression boots if holding pharmacologic prophylaxis

GI / Nutrition

🗆 Famotidine 20mg IV BID in intubated patients; Pantoprazole 20-40mg IV
daily if history of GERD or GI bleed

🗆 Review nutrition, consult nutrition if not already done.  While
awaiting nutrition input, start enteral nutrition:

- In most patients, Osmolite 1.5 @10mL/hr, advance by 20mL Q6h to goal
50mL/hr

- If renal failure and high K or phos: Nepro @ 10mL/hr, advance by 10mL
Q6h to goal 40mL/hr

- MVI with minerals daily

- thiamine 100mg daily x3 days

- folate 1mg daily x 3 days

🗆 Ask: Is bowel regimen adequate? Make changes if necessary.

🗆 Review glucose range over past 48h and insulin regimen, adjust regimen
if needed.

- Goal glucose range is 70-180

Tubes / Lines / Drains

🗆 List all tubes / lines / drains and discuss if any can be removed or
should be changed

Patient / Family Communication

🗆 Discuss if patient has healthcare making capacity - if not, activate
healthcare proxy

🗆 Update families by phone

- Suggest RN update at least daily

- MD update Q3 days, with any significant clinical change, or per family
request

Disposition

🗆 Discuss anticipated dispo, barriers to dispo

Code Status

🗆 Review current code status, discuss if goals of care are realistic
with prognosis - if not, discuss with patient / family

Abbreviations:

SAT = Spontaneous Awakening Trial

SBT = Spontaneous Breathing Trial

CAM = Confusion Assessment Method

RASS = Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale
