**COVID-19 Critical Care Clinical Guidelines**

**This document is a work in progress. We have much to learn.**

**This is updated regularly with evolving information; do not print.**

**Please send suggestions:** BWHCOVIDGuidelines@gmail.com

Coming this week: more advanced website with mobile optimization!

Updated the week of March 30th includes:

-  Discharge planning

-  Changed PEEP recommendations

-  NIPPV/HFNC recommendations

-  New therapeutics

-  Cardiac arrests

-  Palliative recommendations

-  Ethical considerations

**Disclaimer:** This document is intended as a resource for clinicians
caring for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, based on available evidence
and recommendations of governing bodies. The recommendations do not
replace clinical judgment or the need for individualized patient care
plans. While we attempt to keep this document up-to-date, the literature
on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and we suggest that practitioners
search for the most up-to-date literature on any specific topic. These
guidelines will also rapidly evolve as they are implemented into
clinical practice and we receive feedback from practitioners. Finally,
these guidelines were developed based on practice patterns and
infrastructure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA; local
factors should be taken into account if utilized at other hospitals.

1: Clinical Course, Prognosis, and Epidemiology
===============================================

Clinical course
---------------

Clinical presentation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Non-specific, flu-like illness, with myalgias

2. Fever (44-98%)

3. Cough (46-82%)

4. Shortness of breath (20-64%)

5. Upper respiratory symptoms, nasal / sinus congestion (5-25%)

6. Anosmia (Anecdotal reports summarized by ENT groups in
   `USA <https://www.entnet.org/content/aao-hns-anosmia-hyposmia-and-dysgeusia-symptoms-coronavirus-disease>`__,
   `UK <https://www.entuk.org/sites/default/files/files/Loss%20of%20sense%20of%20smell%20as%20marker%20of%20COVID.pdf>`__)

7. GI symptoms (10%; can be before respiratory symptoms)

Transmission
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Large droplets and fomites most often, aerosols less often

   a. Viral particles survive < 24h on cardboard, < 72h on plastic or
      steel

   b. Aerosols (droplet nuclei, < 5 µm), estimated < 4h (`van Dorelmalen
      et al, New Engl J Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32182409>`__)

2. Incubation period: median 4 days, common range 2-7 days, up to 24
   days

3. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus

Disease Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ~ 80% do not require critical care

2. ~ 10-20% develop bacterial superinfection

3. ~ 2-25% have respiratory viral co-infection (Qingdao, China: `Xing et
   al, medRxiv, 2020
   preprint <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2>`__;
   Stanford, CA, USA: `Shah N, Medium, 2020 unpublished
   data <https://medium.com/@nigam/higher-co-infection-rates-in-covid19-b24965088333>`__)

4. ~ 20% develop ARDS

5. ~ 5% develop renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy

6. Elevated AST / ALT (~200s) is common; fulminant hepatitis not
   reported

7. Cardiomyopathy in critically ill patients; some progress to
   cardiogenic shock late in course (anecdotal reports)

Reasons for ICU admission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common indication for ICU.

   a. Reports of rapid progression to intubation within 12-24h

2. Few patients with shock, can develop late in course

3. Median time from symptom onset to ICU transfer is ~10 days

Prognosis
---------

Poor prognostic indicators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *This section is in development.*

2. Demographics: Age > 65, male

3. Comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (includes hypertension),
   pulmonary disease, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression

4. Lab findings: severe lymphopenia, elevated troponin, elevated
   creatinine, elevated LDH, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer

Cause of death
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ~53% respiratory failure

2. ~33% concomitant respiratory and heart failure

3. ~7% cardiac or heart failure alone

4. Mortality rate correlates with age and availability of medical
   resources (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__)

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Chest imaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Portable CXR is sufficient in most cases. Avoid routine daily CXR
   (unlikely to change management, evaluate case-by-case). Avoid CT
   chest unless otherwise indicated.

   a. **Chest x-ray:** Chest imaging variable; bilateral patchy
      opacities most common.

   b. **CT chest:** Chest CT often will not change treatment; obtain
      only if necessary (risk of transmission, time associated with
      transport / decontamination of equipment).

   c. **Point of care ultrasound:** Point of care ultrasound of the
      lungs can be used but by experienced providers only.

Other studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Avoid other studies unless really necessary due to PPE limitations
   and transmission risk associated with transport.

   a. Avoid routine TTEs (for cardiac studies, see: `“Cardiac
      Complications of COVID” chapter <#_6zfga8b63w2s>`__).

Respiratory Escalation Pathway and Intubation
---------------------------------------------

For persons *NOT* under investigation for COVID-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Nasal Cannula, venturi mask:**

   a. Continue standard practices

2. **Noninvasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula:**

   a. Indications remain the same (including OSA)

   b. Because rates of asymptomatic carriage in the community are
      unknown, and aerosolization risk is unknown, wherever possible:

      i.   Consider alternate options as available (e.g., nocturnal
           nasal cannula.)

      ii.  Use airborne precautions (Strict isolation, N95, negative
           pressure room)

      iii. Use a closed circuit: BWH NIPPV machine with dual limb with a
           HEPA filter and BWH mask without anti-asphyxia valve.

      iv.  Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is minimal air leak

      v.   Avoid use of home NIV devices (particularly if single limb
           with anti-asphyxia valve)

   c. Treat as though this person is a PUI (see below)

3. **Cardiac Arrest:**

   a. Treat as though this person is a PUI (see below)

For Persons Under Investigation (PUI) or with confirmed COVID-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Nasal Cannula:**

   a. Use humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1 to 8 LPM for target SpO2
      92-96%.

   b. If a patient requires >6L, consult ICU (COVID ICU Triage, p39999)
      for consideration of ICU transfer. If on floor, consult anesthesia
      for assessment and close monitoring (COVID Anesthesia Team,
      p39265).

      i. *This does not mean the patient necessarily needs to be
         intubated at this or needs immediate ICU transfer*.

1. **Venturi Mask:**

   a. If a patient requires > 8 LPM NC, initiate dry Venturi mask
      (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk)

      i.  Start at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%

      ii. Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not exceeding FiO2
          35%)

          1. If FiO2 > 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM

2. **Noninvasive Ventilation and High Flow Nasal Cannula:**

   a. NIPPV and HFNC should NOT be used in most circumstances, including
      to delay intubation

      i. For patients already on NIPPV/HFNC, transition to Venturi mask
         or non-rebreather mask if possible, ideally 45 minutes prior to
         intubation

   b. Selected exceptions are outlined in detail in the respiratory
      chapter of this document and include:

      i.   Rapidly reversible etiologies (e.g. flash pulmonary edema)

      ii.  Known OSA/TBM without a good alternative

      iii. Select DNI patients as a bridge to family arrival or
           intervention

   c. If NIPPV/HFNC is used, it must be under strict airborne
      precautions including a negative pressure room

3. **Early intubation:**

   a. If venturi mask FiO2 = 60% or SpO2 < 92% (or for hypercapnia or
      work of breathing), call for intubation and pre-oxygenate with
      non-rebreather

      i. In ED this is the on-call provider, for Floor page COVID
         Anesthesia Team p39265

   b. Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) should be performed, avoiding
      bagging

      i.   by the most experienced airway provider

      ii.  using a video laryngoscope (`SCCM COVID19
           Guidelines <https://sccm.org/getattachment/Disaster/SSC-COVID19-Critical-Care-Guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US&_zs=WSjjd1&_zl=j1cc6>`__)
           (`APSF Considerations for Airway Manipulation,
           3/20/2020 <https://www.apsf.org/news-updates/perioperative-considerations-for-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/>`__).

      iii. For more detailed instructions, see intubation chapter

Other Management Principles 
---------------------------

Medical management:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Management is largely supportive. Antiviral and immune-modulating
   therapies are investigational. Further details in `“COVID Therapies
   and Clinical Trials”
   chapter <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arxC_2CCuHSA5jyFDPvBlW31yArLinMvjwD3FM5PeI4/edit#heading=h.kx686gedgtzg>`__.

   a. Fluid management should be conservative due to risk of
      hypoxia/CHF. Further details in fluids section.

Early Advance Care Planning:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In conscious patients, review or sign Health Care Proxy form and
   discuss and document goals of care on admission

   a. Educate patient and family on disease course and prognosis

   b. Focus on desired quality of life and tolerance for ICU measures

   c. Early consultation of palliative care if appropriate

Triage to ICU 
-------------

Consult the ICU triage team EARLY for: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Provider concern

2. Respiratory distress

   a. Need O2 > 6 LPM to maintain SpO2 > 92% or PaO2 > 65.

   b. Rapid escalation of oxygen requirement.

   c. Significant work of breathing.

3. Hemodynamic instability after initial conservative fluid
   resuscitation

   a. SBP < 90, Mean arterial pressure < 65, or Heart rate > 120.

4. Acidosis

   a. ABG with pH < 7.3 or PCO2 > 50 or above patient’s baseline.

   b. Lactate > 2.

5. Need for intensive nursing care or frequent laboratory draws
   requiring arterial line.

6. Severe comorbid illness / high risk for deterioration.

Transfer Process
----------------

See also **ICU Strict Isolation Procedures Manual.**

ED to Floor
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *This section is in development*

Floor / ED to ICU:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ICU RN brings ICU bed to the floor for transfer (to avoid bed
   transfer in COVID precautions room and subsequent bed cleaning).

2. Patient wears surgical mask, with an extra clean gown and sheet on
   top.

3. Providers wear standard PPE during transport.

4. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE

5. Necessary tests (*e.g.* CT), should be obtained during transfer if
   possible.

ICU to floor: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. RN wears standard PPE

2. Patient travels in wheelchair or stretcher

3. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE

Floor to discharge:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. RN wears standard PPE

2. Patient travels in wheelchair

3. Security facilitates the shortest and fastest transfer route, walks 6
   ft away from patient and providers, not required to wear PPE

4. Patient is escorted directly into vehicle; contact care management if
   patient does not have access to a personal vehicle

Discharge Planning (Inpatient)
------------------------------

Discharge criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Consider discharge for patients’ who meet the following clinical
   criteria:

   a. Resolution of fever >48 hours without antipyretics

   b. Improvement in illness signs and symptoms (cough, SOB, and oxygen
      requirement)

Discharge for patients with unstable housing or who leave Against Medical Advice (AMA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *Additional resources for patients with unstable housing and requests
   for AMA discharge are in development.*

Confirmed COVID-19 Discharge Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **If unable to complete any components of checklist:**\ *review
   community resources, discuss transportation and post-acute care
   options with care coordination and consider ongoing hospitalization*

Discharge contingencies

-  Verify and document contact number for patient and primary support
   person; ensure active phone service, voicemail functioning, and
   language preference correctly documented

-  Verify residence with private room, ability to adhere to home
   isolation instructions and risk of transmission to persons with
   immunocompromising conditions in the home

-  Confirm ability to manage ADL/iADLs with degree of support at home

-  Confirm that patient has resources/social support to receive 1-2
   weeks of food and other necessary supplies while under quarantine

-  Perform DME needs assessment and consider sponsorship from hospital
   if item unable to be delivered or obtained by primary support person

Discharge medications/supplies

-  Provide 30-day supply of medications to cover duration of home
   isolation, recommend meds-to-bed delivery if available

-  Provide a surgical mask *as available* to infected patients who are
   discharging home (instructions for use in discharge instructions)

Transportation

-  Verify patient has a ride by private vehicle or arrange
   transportation via ambulance (infected person should wear mask in
   vehicle)

Discharge instructions

-  Counsel patient on voluntary isolation procedures and use standard
   Epic Smart Phrase SPUCOUNSELING

-  Use standard Epic Smart Phrases SPUDISCHARGECOVIDPOSITIVE or
   SPUDISCHARGECOVIDNEGATIVE for discharge and home isolation
   instructions

Ambulatory follow-up plan

-  Verify and document patient’s primary care provider

-  Provide warm handoff via phone or in-basket message to patient’s
   primary care provider and confirm that they are able/willing to
   answer questions post-discharge

Community resources

-  Provide `language-appropriate document reviewing community
   resources <https://docs.google.com/document/d/14JYALTcbGrwXwL2OipH0BSCYcT4TzkryMd06RSiHaRs/edit>`__

3: Respiratory Support
======================

Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pathophysiology 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Histology of COVID-19 associated lung disease shows bilateral diffuse
   alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of
   pneumocytes, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation.

2. There is also some evidence of direct viral injury to lung tissue.
   (`Xu et al, Lancet Respir Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085846>`__).

Definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Many patients with COVID-19 who require ICU level of care will
   develop ARDS.

2. The Berlin definition of ARDS requires the following four criteria:

   a. Acute (onset over 1 week or less)

   b. Bilateral opacities detected on CT or chest radiograph

   c. PF ratio <300mmHg with a minimum of 5 cmH20 PEEP (or CPAP)

   d. Must not be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload

======== =========================== =============================
Severity PaO2/FiO2 (on PEEP/CPAP >5) Mortality (all cause, cohort)
Mild     200-300                     27%
Moderate 100-200                     32%
Severe   <100                        45%
======== =========================== =============================

Time course
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Anecdotally, many report that progression of hypoxemic respiratory
   failure occurs rapidly (within ~12-24 hours).

2. From onset of symptoms, the median time to:

   a. Development of ARDS: 8-12 days (`Wang et al, JAMA,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__; `Zhou et
      al, Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__;
      `Huang et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264>`__)

   b. Mechanical ventilation: 10.5-14.5 days (`Huang et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986264>`__; `Zhou et
      al, Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__)

Management of Hypoxemia for COVID PUI/ Confirmed Cases
------------------------------------------------------

Supplemental Oxygen Escalation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *Nasal cannula:*

   a. Initial oxygen delivery should be humidified nasal cannula (NC) 1
      to 8 LPM for target SpO2 92-96%.

      i. If a patient requires >6L, anesthesia requests *early*
         consultation for assessment and preparation. (COVID anesthesia
         pager p39265)

         1. This does *not* mean they necessarily need intubation.

2. *Venturi mask:*

   a. If a patient requires > 8 LPM NC, initiate dry Venturi mask
      (non-humidified to reduce aerosolization risk)

      i.  Start at 9 LPM and FiO2 28%, and notify the ICU triage pager

      ii. Up-titrate FiO2 to goal SpO2 of 92-96% (not exceeding FiO2
          35%)

          1. If FiO2 > 35% then increase flow to 12 LPM

Early intubation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. For patients maintained on a Venturi mask;

   a. once FiO2 = 60% and SpO2 < 92%, call for intubation (COVID
      anesthesia pager p39265)

      i. Consider other indications for intubation (tachypnea, work of
         breathing).

2. Avoid NIPPV or HFNC to stave off intubation (see discussion below)

   a. For patients already on NIPPV/HFNC, transition to Venturi mask or
      non-rebreather mask if possible, ideally 45 minutes prior to
      intubation

3. Rapid Sequence Induction(RSI) should be performed

   a. by the most experienced airway provider

   b. using a video laryngoscope (`SCCM COVID19
      Guidelines <https://sccm.org/getattachment/Disaster/SSC-COVID19-Critical-Care-Guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US&_zs=WSjjd1&_zl=j1cc6>`__)(`APSF
      Considerations for Airway Manipulation,
      3/20/2020 <https://www.apsf.org/news-updates/perioperative-considerations-for-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/>`__).

   c. For more detailed instructions, see intubation chapter

4. Intubations outside the ICU should be attended by the Resource RT,
   who can facilitate early and appropriate ventilator settings

Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) and High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **We recommend avoiding high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and
   non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV; i.e. CPAP/BiPAP)
   in most circumstances**

   a. There is a paucity of data on the increased aerosol risk of these
      interventions, and their role in increasing transmission.

      i.   General consensus suggests that HFNC and NIPPV increase the
           risk of viral transmission, but the degree of aerosolization
           is poorly understood and data on this is lacking. `WHO
           interim guidance (published March 13,
           2020) <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__
           recommends it only in select patients.

      ii.  A systematic review on SARS found that NIPPV was associated
           with increased risk of viral transmission to healthcare
           workers (n=2 studies), but HFNC was not (n=1) (`Tran et al,
           PLoS One,
           2012 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563403>`__)

      iii. Other studies with very limited power exist, such as a
           post-hoc analysis that found no secondary infections in
           medical staff from patients with influenza H1N1 treated with
           HFNC (but n=20) (`Rello et al, J Crit Care,
           2012 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762937>`__);

   b. Given the rapid progression of disease in most patients, we do not
      anticipate many patients would avoid intubation using NIPPV/HFNC,
      but this remains unknown.

      i.  Case reports from China suggest high failure rates for
          non-invasive ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen
          (`Zuo et al, Chin Med Sci J,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102726>`__), though
          there are some patients who may recover on HFNC.

      ii. Generally, NIPPV is thought to stave off intubation only in
          early ARDS and the data is inconsistent (`Rochberg et al, ERJ,
          2016 <http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:34491883>`__).

2. **Exceptions to this include:**

   a. *As a short-term bridge to ventilator availability:*

      i. If a patient would otherwise be a candidate for intubation but
         no ventilator is immediately available, NIPPV/HFNC can be
         considered as a bridge

   b. *For rapidly reversible causes of hypoxemia:*

      i. e.g. flash pulmonary edema, mucus plug, or witnessed small
         aspiration

   c. *For Obstructive Sleep Apnea or Tracheobronchomalacia:*

      i.  Where possible, patients with mild or moderate OSA should be
          transitioned to nocturnal nasal cannula.

      ii. Patients on home nocturnal NIPPV for severe sleep apnea may
          continue NIPPV, but must use a BWH device with the
          specifications below. Patients may not use home NIPPV mask or
          nasal pillow or single-limb machine due to increased aerosol
          risk.

   a. *For select DNI patients or those not eligible for intubation:*

      i. this should be used only as a bridge to a short-term aim such
         as a family member’s arrival or an intervention

3. **If HFNC or NIPPV are used:**

   a. For HFNC, patient wears surgical mask and limit flow rate to < 30
      L/min

   b. For BiPAP, use BWH NIPPV machine with dual limb with a HEPA filter
      and BWH mask without anti-asphyxia valve

   c. Use under strict airborne precautions, including N95s, strict
      isolation, and a negative pressure room.

   d. Ensure masks/devices fit well and there is minimal air leak

      i. Measured exhaled air distances are minimally increased with
         CPAP pressures up to 20 cm H2O and HFNC up to 60 LPM;
         importantly device/interface leaks cause significant lateral
         air travel (`Hui et al, Eur Respir J,
         2019 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705129>`__)

Initial Mechanical Ventilation
------------------------------

Checklist Following intubation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set the initial ventilator settings:

   a. Initiate ARDS ventilation as described below

   b. Determine PEEP and mechanics as described below

   c. Assure adequate sedation as described below

2. Obtain STAT portable CXR to confirm endotracheal tube location

   a. Prioritize CXR and vent settings over procedures (such as central
      venous catheter placement) if possible.

3. Complete the “Mechanical Ventilation with Sedation” orderset in EPIC

4. Obtain an ABG (preferred) or a VBG within 30 minutes

   a. Calculate P/F ratio from initial post-intubation ABG. Adjust
      oxygenation as described below

   b. Goal pH 7.25 to 7.45 adjust ventilation as described below

Initial ARDS Ventilation Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Set mode to volume control (AC/VC)**

2. **Set Initial tidal volume (Vt):**

   a. Vt = 6 ml/kg (based on ideal body weight [IBW] from ARDSnet table,
      see table below)

      i.  IBW men (kg) = 50 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)

      ii. IBW women (kg) = 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)

|image1|

3. **Set Initial respiratory rate 16-24, higher if acidosis present.**

4. **Set an Initial PEEP based on BMI:**

   a. BMI < 35: PEEP 5

   b. BMI > 35: PEEP 10

5. **Initial FiO2:** 100% on intubation then *rapidly* wean to SpO2
   92-96% (`Barrot et al, N Engl J Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661>`__)

Determining optimal PEEP, and mechanics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Titrate FiO2 and PEEP for oxygenation**

   a. Initiate PEEP based on BMI, per above, and then titrate PEEP and
      FiO2 to target oxygenation SpO2 92-96% as per the following
      guidelines:

      i. BMI < 35: titrate PEEP and FiO2 as per the ARDSnet LOW PEEP
         table

..

   |image2|

ii. BMI ≥ 35: titrate PEEP and FiO2 as per the ARDSnet HIGH PEEP table

..

   |image3|

b. If SpO2 < 92% or > 96% then titrate PEEP and FiO2 according to the
   ARDSnet table as per BMI

c. Special consideration: anecdotal reports of COVID-19 patients
   describe a compliant, highly PEEP dependent phenotype in which PEEP
   management may not strictly adhere to specified ARDSnet tables

   i. PEEP titration may be appropriate (see section below)

2. **Obtain** **respiratory mechanics**:

   a. Plateau pressure (with goal < 30, management below)

   b. Static compliance

Sedation and Ventilator Synchrony
---------------------------------

1. **If paralyzed, target sedation to RASS -2 to -3 (see table below):**

   a. Maintain deep sedation immediately post-intubation while paralyzed
      (assume 60 minutes for Rocuronium, 10 minutes for succinylcholine)

      i.   Preferred initial sedation regimen:

           1. Fentanyl/Hydromorphone (boluses +/- infusion) + Propofol:
              target analgosedation and optimize analgesia first while
              decreasing sedative requirements

              a. Measure triglycerides and lipase every third day on
                 propofol or earlier if other reasons for
                 hypertriglyceridemia

      ii.  Adjunct agent: Midazolam

      iii. Use dexmedetomidine only when nearing extubation

2. **In unparalyzed, target sedation to ventilator synchrony:**

   a. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is common in patients who
      are not synchronous with the ventilator and can cause significant
      lasting damage\ **.** After paralytics have worn off, assess
      patient synchrony with the ventilator (*e.g.*, signs of
      breath-stacking, double triggering, other ventilator alarms).

      i.  Titrate sedatives/analgesics to ventilator synchrony allowing
          for deeper RASS.

      ii. If patient remains dyssynchronous despite deep sedation (RASS
          -5), initiate continuous paralytics (ensure BIS 40 to 60 prior
          to initiating and during paralysis).

Ventilator Adjustments and Daily Management
-------------------------------------------

General management of ventilated patients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Consider whether patient requires daily CXR:

   a. CXR clearly indicated for:

      i.  Clinical change

      ii. Concern for displaced ET tube:

          1. Sudden increase in peak inspiratory pressure or resistance

          2. Decreased, unilateral breath sounds (usually on the right)

          3. RN or RT concern for change in depth of ET tube at teeth

2. COVID-19 ICU Bundle:

   a. Ventilated patients should all have a daily ICU “Bundle” of best
      practices. See `Addendum
      1 <#addendum-covid-icu-bundle-checklist>`__ for a proposed
      “COVID-19 ICU Bundle”.

3. Ventilator consults:

   a. If you need additional assistance managing ventilator choices, you
      can request a pulmonary phone/in-person consult

Changing ventilation parameters (respiratory rate and tidal volume)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Follow ARDSnet ventilation where possible:**

   a. Tidal volumes should be 4-6 cc/kg using IBW (see table above) to
      minimize volumes (and thus ventilator injury).

2. **Minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume) typically
   drives pH and PCO2:**

   a. Titrate ventilatory parameters to pH, not PCO2.

      i.  To achieve low tidal volumes, we tolerate hypercapnia
          (functionally no limitation unless clinical sequelae) and
          acidemia (pH > 7.2).

      ii. Because tidal volumes are low, the respiratory rate often has
          to be high to accommodate; typical RR is 20-35 breaths/minute.

3. **pH goal is normally 7.25-7.45:**

   i.   If pH > 7.45, decrease respiratory rate

   ii.  If pH 7.15-7.30, then increase respiratory rate until pH > 7.30,
        or PaCO2 < 25 (maximum RR= 35 breaths/minute)

   iii. If pH < 7.15, then increase respiratory rate to 35
        breaths/minute

   iv.  If pH still < 7.15, then perform the following:

        1. Tidal volume may be increased by 1 mL/kg until pH > 7.15
           (until plateau pressure reaches 30 cm H2O or tidal volume
           reaches 8 cc/kg)

        2. Deep sedation advancing to RASS -5 if needed

        3. If no improvement, initiate continuous paralysis

        4. If still no improvement, initiate prone ventilation (may
           improve V/Q matching and better ventilation)

Changing oxygenation parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Minimize oxygen toxicity:** PEEP and Fi02 drive oxygenation

   i. The goal is to deliver a partial pressure of oxygen to perfuse
      tissues (PaO2 > 75, Sp02 >92%) [1]_ while limiting lung injury
      from high distending pressures (Ppl < 30) and hyperoxia (**FiO2 <
      75**, SpO2 < 96%) [2]_.

      1. Lower limit goals for PaO2 / SpO2 are widely debated; PaO2 > 55
         and SpO2 >88% are also commonly used at BWH.

2. **Optimize PEEP:**

   i.  Initial PEEP should be set as explained above.

   ii. *This section is under development. PEEP titration will be
       included soon.*

3. **Adjust Fi02:**

   i.  Adjust Fi02 after optimizing PEEP

   ii. Goal FiO2 < 75%; if FiO2 > 75%; patient requires ventilator
       optimization. If you need assistance, pulmonary consultation is
       available (pager 11957)

       1. It is reasonable to put a desaturating patient temporarily on
          100% Fi02, but remember to wean oxygen as rapidly as possible

4. **Checking plateau pressure:**

   i.   Check plateau pressure with every change in tidal volume, PEEP,
        or clinical deterioration (worsening oxygenation) but not as
        part of routine practice

   ii.  If plateau pressure is > 30 cm H20, then decrease tidal volume
        by 1 ml/kg (minimum 4 mL/kg)

   iii. If plateau pressure is < 25 H20 and tidal volume < 6 mL/kg, then
        increase tidal volume by 1 mL/kg until plateau pressure is > 25
        cm H2O or tidal volume = 6 mL/kg

   iv.  If plateau pressure is < 30 cm H20 and patient is breath
        stacking or dyssynchronous, then increase tidal volume in mL/kg
        increments to 7 mL/kg or 8 mL/kg so long as plateau pressure is
        < 30 cm H20

Refractory hypoxemia
--------------------

1. **Refractory Hypoxemia pathway:**

   a. If patient is hypoxic (Pa02 <55) on Vt = 6 ml/kg, ideal PEEP from
      PV tool (or PEEP determination from ARDSnet table for non-Hamilton
      G5 ventilators), and Fi02 >75%, perform the following in this
      order:

      i.   Optimize volume status by diuresing or RRT if possible;

           1. if no improvement then:

      ii.  Deep sedation, advancing to RASS -5 if needed;

           1. if no improvement then:

      iii. Initiate continuous paralysis (cisatracurium bolus 0.2mg/kg
           followed by infusion at 0-5 mcg/kg/min titrated to
           patient-ventilator synchrony);

           1. if no improvement then:

      iv.  Initiate prone ventilation (see below); high consideration
           for use early in severe ARDS (<36 hours from ARDS onset,
           start discussion of proning when P:F < 150, prone within 12
           hours of FiO2 > 75%)

           1. if no improvement then:

      v.   Initiate continuous inhaled epoprostenol (see `“COVID-19
           Therapies and Clinical Trials” chapter <#_kx686gedgtzg>`__),
           and call the ECMO team

           1. If no improvement then;

      vi.  Consider ECMO if offered

Proning 
~~~~~~~

1. **Prone early:**

   a. We recommend early proning in severe ARDS without vasodilator
      trial (a departure from our typical practice for ARDS not due to
      COVID-19): < 36 hours from ARDS onset, start discussion of prone
      when P:F < 150, prone within 12 hours of FiO2 > 75% (`Guérin et
      al, N Engl J Med,
      2013 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23688302>`__).

2. **Eligibility criteria for proning:**

   a. The only absolute contraindications to proned ventilation are
      spinal cord injury and open chest; BMI and patient size are not
      contraindications

   b. Eligibility may vary depending on resources and staffing.
      Currently we recommend:

      i.   Age < 75

      ii.  No high grade shock (either single agent norepinephrine 20
           mcg/min or norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min and vasopressin)

      iii. Not on CRRT or at risk of impending renal failure (due to
           difficulties in maintaining dialysis access while proned)

3. **To initiate prone ventilation outside of MICU and 11C:**

   i.  Discuss with the PCCM Consultation team assigned to that unit

   ii. ICU charge nurse to contact MICU charge nurse for nursing
       assistance

4. **Managing a proned patient:**

   i.   Proning protocol is available in the MICU Sharepoint, or an
        abbreviated version will be made available soon

   ii.  Maintain deep sedation with target RASS -4 to -5 while proned.

   iii. 1 hour post-initiation of prone ventilation:

        1. Adjust oxygen parameters: re-assess lung mechanics (plateau
           pressure and re-optimize PEEP, see above

        2. Assess tidal volume and adjust ventilation parameters as in
           section 6

           a. If Vt < 6 ml/kg, may increase to maximum limit of 8 ml/kg
              while Ppl < 30 (preferred maximum is 6 ml/kg)

   iv.  If patient demonstrates improvement on proning then recommend:

        1. Discontinuing of continuous neuromuscular blockade and
           re-assess ventilator dyssynchrony; re-institute if
           dyssynchronous

        2. Return to supine ventilation when following criteria are met:

           a. Ppl < 25

           b. FiO2 < 50%

           c. pH > 7.3

           d. P:F > 200

   v.   Repositioning and skin care while proned:

        1. Currently we recommend continuing proning as per the MICU
           proning protocol. This may change in the future depending on
           availability of PPE and staffing.

ECMO consultation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If despite all the above measures the patient meets the following
   criteria, then consider ECMO consult (pager 35010):

   i.   Ppl > 30

   ii.  FiO2 > 75%

   iii. P:F < 80

2. **Candidacy:** Final ECMO guidelines for COVID-19 patients remain
   under development. Examples of common considerations include:

   i.    Patient age < 65

   ii.   Mechanical ventilation duration < 7 days

   iii.  BMI < 35 and patient body weight < 150 kg

   iv.   CrCl > 30

   v.    No multiorgan failure or high grade shock (can be on single
         pressor; norepinephrine < 15 mcg/min)

   vi.   No active solid or liquid malignancy

   vii.  Absolute neutrophil count > 500

   viii. Platelets > 50,000

   ix.   Able to tolerate anticoagulation on initiation (no active
         hemorrhage)

   x.    No evidence of irreversible neurological injury

   xi.   Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

Infectious Diseases Consultation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The inpatient Infectious Diseases (ID) team should be consulted for
   patients with +COVID-19 PCR as well as patients with both clinical
   history and any chest imaging suspicious for COVID-19.

2. Re-consultation should occur if the patient develops ARDS
   (mechanically-ventilated with P/F ratio < 300) or shock/cytokine
   activation syndrome.

Clinical Trials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ID teams are enrolling for ongoing clinical trials of antiviral
   agents. ID and the PETAL network are coordinating to enroll for
   clinical trials of host-response modifying therapies (see `“Systemic
   Corticosteroids” <#systemic-corticosteroids>`__ and `“Anti-IL6

2. Some patients may also arrive at the ICU already enrolled in a
   COVID-19 clinical trial. In such cases, verify that ICU treatment
   regimen does not add harmful drug interactions with study agents.

Antibiotics
-----------

Choice of agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clinical reports indicate that rates of bacterial superinfection of
   COVID19 are low (10-20%), but when present increase mortality risk.
   Anecdotal reports suggest less MRSA superinfection than is often seen
   with influenza. Unnecessary antibiotics carry risks of fluid overload
   and drug-resistance, as well as the possibility that antibiotics may
   become a limited resource. (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__; `Yang et al,
   Lancet Respir Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632>`__; `Lippi and
   Plebani, Clinica Chimica Acta,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145275>`__; `WHO, COVID-19
   Interim guidance, March
   2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__)\ **.**

2. Antibiotics should reflect IDSA guidelines, presumed source, and MDRO
   risk.

   a. For empiric coverage for a presumed pulmonary source of infection:

      i.  In patients **without** risk factors for MRSA or *Pseudomonas*
          (*i.e.*, living in community, no prior MDROs), start with
          ceftriaxone + azithromycin.

      ii. In patients **with** risk factors for MRSA or *Pseudomonas*
          (*i.e.*, chronic hospitalization, prior MDR infections), start
          with vancomycin + cefepime and consider ciprofloxacin if high
          concern for *Pseudomonas.*

3. For coverage of potential coinfections\ **:**

   a. If concurrent influenza, treat with oseltamivir.

   b. Given prevalence of lymphopenia in clinical presentation of
      COVID-19, consider *Pneumocystis* and treat accordingly.

4. See special dispensations for oncology patients in `“Considerations
   for Oncology Patients” section <#_aayfijcxre19>`__ within `“Other
   Guidance” chapter <#neurologic-manifestations>`__.

Formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Give oral antibiotics (azithromycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin,
   etc.) when possible to reduce volume load, unless concerns for poor
   oral absorption.

Discontinuation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Antibiotics should be discontinued as soon as possible (ideally,
   within 48 hours), given the following criteria are met:

   a. Clinical status is not deteriorating.

   b. Cultures do not reveal pathogens at 48h and/or Procalcitonin and
      WBC are relatively stable from 0 to 48h

2. *Clinical judgement should prevail over any specific lab value.*

Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs) vs. Nebulizers
-------------------------------------------

1. Nebulization may aerosolize viral particles and contribute to disease
   transmission. COVID-19 clinical reports do not indicate wheeze as a
   common symptom, and not all patients require bronchodilators (`Zhou
   et al, Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__;
   `Yang et al, Lancet Respir Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632>`__; `Guan et al, N
   Engl J Med, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109013>`__;
   `WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance, March
   2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__).

Non-intubated patients 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask patients / families to bring in their home inhalers if possible.

2. If COVID-19 is confirmed or suspected:

   a. Use MDI (inhalers), NOT nebulizers, due to the increased aerosol
      risk associated with nebulization. Because MDI supply is limited,
      only prescribe when needed.

3. In patients WITHOUT suspicion for COVID-19 or COVID-19 negative:

   a. Use nebulizers even if on droplet precautions (*e.g.,* influenza)
      because MDI supply is limited.

4. If COVID is ruled out (and no patient is longer on COVID precautions
   per infection control)

   a. Continue patient’s current inhalers until they run out, then
      switch to nebulizers.

Intubated patients 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. At BWH, an in-line nebulizer container is part of a closed ventilator
   circuit, so nebulizers can be used without opening the circuit and
   increasing aerosol risk.

   a. Other hospitals may need to add this setup or add other options,
      such as a Heat-Moisture-Exchanger that allows MDI delivery into a
      closed circuit.

Airway Clearance 
----------------

Management principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Anecdotal reports from Wuhan and Italy indicate that some patients
   develop very thick secretions causing dangerous mucus plugging.
   However, use of nebulizers and airway clearance techniques may
   aerosolize secretions.

   a. Airway clearance should be used only in **selected ventilated
      patients (closed-circuit)** with extremely thick secretions to
      avoid mucus plugging that would require bronchoscopy.

Secretion thinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Nebulized treatments

   a. **Only use in ventilated patients on strict airborne precautions
      in a negative-pressure room.**

   b. Options include:

      i.   Normal (0.9%) saline nebulizer BID.

      ii.  Dornase alfa 2.5mg nebulizer once daily, as part of a
           clinical trial [3]_.

           1. Note that this can cause bronchoconstriction and mucosal
              bleeding.

           2. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg, just prior to delivery.

           3. Avoid in setting of bloody secretions.

      iii. Nebulized hypertonic (3-7%) saline once daily is of unclear
           benefit and may not be worth risk of bronchospasm

           1. If using, start with 3% saline to assess response and
              bronchoconstriction.

           2. Pre-treat with albuterol 2.5mg just prior to delivery

      iv.  Avoid N-acetylcysteine due to bronchospasm and frequent
           dosing requirements

Mechanical airway clearance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Avoid oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (Aerobika or
   Acapella) and cough assist (MIE).

2. Avoid routine use of chest PT, but can continue chest PT vests if
   patient uses at home (*e.g.,* CF patients) with appropriate isolation
   precautions. Patients with bronchiectasis may be considered on a
   case-by-case basis.

Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators
------------------------------

Indications
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. There is no evidence of survival benefit of inhaled vasodilators in
   ARDS, and there are risks of viral aerosolization when connecting the
   device (`Fuller et al, Chest,
   2015 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742022>`__; `Gebistorf et
   al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev,
   2016 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347773>`__; `Afshari et
   al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev,
   2017 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806480>`__).

2. Given this, inhaled vasodilators should **NOT** be routinely used,
   except in two circumstances:

   a. As a rescue strategy in already prone ventilated patients (see
      “respiratory” chapter).

   b. To reduce RV afterload in hemodynamically-significant RV failure
      in consultation with Cardiology.

Instructions for use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If inhaled vasodilators are used, their use should be reevaluated at
   4 hours.

   a. First, try inhaled epoprostenol (Veletri):

      i.  Start continuous nebulization at 0.05 mcg/kg/min based on IBW
          (`MDcalc online
          calculator <https://www.mdcalc.com/ideal-body-weight-adjusted-body-weight>`__).

      ii. If no improvement in P/F ratio in 2 hours, wean off by
          decreasing 0.01mcg/kg/min every hour.

   b. If no response to epoprostenol, strongly consider use of inhaled
      nitric oxide (iNO) in refractory ARDS:

      i.   Limited *in vitro* data notes that iNO at high doses inhibits
           replication of SARS-CoV, but this has not been studied *in
           vivo* (`Akerstrom et al, J Virol,
           2005 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650225>`__;
           `Gebistorf et al, Cochrane Database Syst Rev,
           2016 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27347773>`__).

      ii.  Inhaled NO may be included in future trial protocols, such as
           early initiation in milder disease (non-intubated).

      iii. Dosing regimen will be linked here soon

Systemic Corticosteroids
------------------------

Evidence
~~~~~~~~

1. Data on corticosteroids for COVID-19 is mixed.

   a. Most studies show negative effects of corticosteroids on similar
      viruses. There is no clinical evidence of net benefit from
      steroids in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza infection, and
      observational data show increased mortality, more secondary
      infections, impaired viral clearance and more adverse effects in
      survivors (*e.g.,* psychosis, diabetes, avascular necrosis) (`Lee
      et al, J Clin Virol,
      2004 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15494274>`__; `Stockman
      et al, PLoS Med,
      2006 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16968120>`__; `Arabi et
      al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med,
      2018 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161116>`__; `WHO,
      COVID-19 Interim guidance, March
      2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__;
      `Wu et al, JAMA Int Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__).

   b. However, there is some evidence toward a potential benefit.
      Specifically, a retrospective cohort trial (201 patients, 42% of
      whom developed ARDS) demonstrated that among patients with
      COVID-19 positive ARDS, methylprednisolone decreased risk of death
      (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72) (`Wu et al, JAMA Int Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__). An
      earlier, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of patients with
      ARDS (not COVID-19) suggested a possible benefit to dexamethasone
      treatment: more ventilator-free days by day 28, and lower
      mortality at day 60 (21% vs 36%) (`Villar et a, Lancet Resp Med,
      2020 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32043986>`__).

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **We recommend against using steroids for COVID-19 except as part of
   a clinical trial or if treating another indication.** This is in line
   with WHO guidance (`WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance, March
   2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__).

2. If treating another indication, use corticosteroids at the lowest
   dose for the shortest duration:

   a. **For asthma or COPD exacerbation**, treat with 40mg prednisone PO
      or 30mg methylprednisolone IV, once daily x 3-5 days.

   b. **For shock with history of chronic steroid use in excess of 10mg
      prednisone daily**, treat with 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until
      improvement in shock.

   c. **For multipressor shock without history of chronic steroid use**,
      treat with 50mg hydrocortisone IV Q6H until improvement in shock.

Anti-IL6 Agents (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab, Sarilumab)
----------------------------------------------------

.. _pathophysiology-1:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. IL-6 activates T cells and macrophages, among other cell types (see
   `“Cytokine Activation Syndrome”
   section <#cytokine-activation-syndrome>`__ in `“Shock”
   chapter <#_dpe5gr1hwjp>`__). IL-6 inhibitors are approved for
   cytokine activation syndrome complications related to Chimeric
   Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy (`Brudno and Kochenderfer,
   Blood Rev, 2019 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528964>`__;
   `Rubin et al, Brain,
   2019 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891590>`__).

2. IL-6 levels are reported to correlate with severe COVID-19. While
   patients have peripheral lymphopenia, BAL fluid is often lymphocytic,
   suggesting that IL-6 inhibition and prevention of T cell activation
   may be protective.

.. _recommendations-1:

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **We do not recommend routine use of anti-IL-6 agents unless part of
   a clinical trial.** There are anecdotal reports of benefit of
   tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients but no rigorous studies are
   available (Anecdotal reports from Italy; `National Health Commission
   & State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Diagnosis and
   Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia [Trial Version 7],
   March
   2020 <http://busan.china-consulate.org/chn/zt/4/P020200310548447287942.pdf>`__)

2. **For severe cases of COVID-19 with suspicion of cytokine activation
   syndrome** (see `“Other Guidance”
   chapter <#neurologic-manifestations>`__), consider use in conjunction
   with Infectious Diseases consultation.

   a. Retrospective reviews in patients with rheumatological disease
      suggest a possible increase in serious bacterial infection, so use
      caution if secondary infection is clinically suspected.

      i. Tocilizumab is routinely used at BWH (*e.g.*, CRS in patients
         after CAR-T cell treatment) without obvious increase in
         bacterial infection.

Dosing regimens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Tocilizumab:** 4-8mg/kg (suggested dose 400mg) IV x1 (anti-IL6R
   mAb). Dose can be repeated 12h later if inadequate response to the
   first dose. Total dose should be no more than 800mg. Tocilizumab
   should not be administered more than twice.

   a. Common adverse effects of tocilizumab include:

      i.   Transaminitis (AST, ALT), >22%

      ii.  Infusion reaction, 4-20%

      iii. Hypercholesterolemia, 20%

      iv.  Upper respiratory tract infection, 7%

      v.   Neutropenia, 2-7%

2. **Alternative - Siltuximab:** 11mg/kg IV x1 (anti-IL6 mAb).

   a. Common adverse effects of siltuximab include:

      i.   Edema, >26%

      ii.  Upper respiratory infection, >26%

      iii. Pruritus / skin rash, 28%

      iv.  Hyperuricemia, 11%

      v.   Lower respiratory tract infection, 8%

      vi.  Thrombocytopenia, 8%

      vii. Hypotension, 4%

3. **Sarilumab:** New intravenous formulation and dosing, available only
   as part of a `clinical
   trial <http://www.news.sanofi.us/2020-03-16-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-begin-global-Kevzara-R-sarilumab-clinical-trial-program-in-patients-with-severe-COVID-19>`__.

   a. Common adverse effects of sarilumab include:

      i.   Transaminitis (AST, ALT), 28-47%

      ii.  Neutropenia, 7-10%

      iii. Infusion reactions, 7%

      iv.  Upper respiratory tract infections, 4%

      v.   Urinary tract infections, 3%

4. **Tocilizumab and sarilumab** both have black box warnings for a risk
   of serious infections, including tuberculosis and other opportunistic
   infections. Patients treated with either agent should be tested for
   latent tuberculosis prior to discharge from the hospital and followed
   up in the TB clinic if that testing is positive.

Remdesivir

Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine
----------------------------------

.. _pathophysiology-2:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an anti-malarial 4-aminoquinoline shown
   to have *in vitro* (but not yet *in vivo*) activity against diverse
   RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 (`Touret and de Lamballerie,
   Antivir Res, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32147496>`__).

2. HCQ is thought to act through multiple mechanisms (`Devaux et al, Int
   J Antimicrob Agent,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171740>`__):

   a. **Inhibition of viral entry.** HCQ inhibits synthesis of sialic
      acids and interferes with protein glycosylation, which may disrupt
      interactions necessary for viral attachment and entry (`Vincent et
      al, Virol J,
      2005 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115318>`__; `Olofsson
      et al, Lancet Infect Dis,
      2005 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15766653>`__).

   b. **Inhibition of viral release into the host cell.** HCQ blocks
      endosomal acidification, which activates endosomal proteases.
      These proteases are required to initiate coronavirus/endosome
      fusion that releases viral particles into the cell (`Yang et al, J
      Virol 2004 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140961>`__).

   c. **Reduction of viral infectivity.** HCQ has been shown to inhibit
      protein glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of viral
      proteins. Studies on other RNA viruses have shown a resulting
      accumulation of non-infective viral particles, or an inability of
      viral particles to bud out of the host cell (`Savarino et al, J
      Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,
      2004 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15076236>`__; `Klumperman
      et al, J Virol,
      1994 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8083990>`__).

   d. **Immune modulation.** HCQ reduces toll-like receptors and
      cGAS-STING signaling. It has been shown to reduce release of a
      number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from several immune cell
      types (`Schrezenmeier and Dorner, Nat Rev Rheum,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034323>`__).

.. _evidence-1:

Evidence
~~~~~~~~

1. An expert consensus group out of China suggests that chloroquine
   improved lung imaging and shortened disease course (`Zhonghua et al,
   CMAPH, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075365>`__).
   Chloroquine will be included in the next treatment guidelines from
   the National Health Commission, but the specific data on which this
   is based is not available yet (`Gao et al, Biosci Trends,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550>`__).

2. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in
   inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 i\ *n vitro* (`Yao et al, Clin Infect Dis,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150618>`__).

.. _recommendations-2:

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Consideration should be given for use of hydroxychloroquine** in
   patients who:

   a. Are not candidates for other clinical trials AND

   b. Require supplemental oxygen OR are inpatients not on supplemental
      oxygen but at high risk for progression to severe disease

Dosing regimens (from published literature)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Hydroxychloroquine:** 400mg PO BID on the first day, followed by
   200mg q12 (q8h if concerns for absorption) for 5 days.

   a. May extend up to 10 days depending on clinical response.

   b. The half-life of HCQ is over 7 days, so a 5-day treatment course
      should still yield therapeutic HCQ levels past day 10 (`Yao et al,
      Clin Infect Dis,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150618>`__).

2. **Chloroquine phosphate:** 500mg PO BID for 10 days.

   a. **Not available at BWH and no plans to start use.**

Monitoring and Toxicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Hydroxychloroquine is contraindicated in epilepsy and porphyria and
   is is known to cause:

   a. Bone marrow suppression

   b. Cardiomyopathy and retinopathy

      i. Case series and reports have found this to be a long-term
         (years) and dose-dependent phenomenon. Given the anticipated
         short duration in COVID-19, it is not an expected risk (`Nord
         et al, Semin Arthritis Rheum,
         2004 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15079764>`__; `Yusuf
         et al, Eye,
         2017 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28282061>`__).

   c. QT-segment prolongation and therefore torsades de pointes,
      especially if administered in combination with azithromycin.

2. Given this, the following monitoring is required for patients being
   treated with hydroxychloroquine:

   a. Obtain baseline ECG, ECG 3.5 hours after first dose, and daily ECG
      thereafter.

   b. Discontinue all other QT-prolonging agents.

   c. Maintain continuous telemetry while under treatment.

   d. Do not start if QTc > 500 msec (or 550 msec with pacing or BBB).

   e. Discontinue if there is an increase in PVCs or non-sustained
      polymorphic VT.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _pathophysiology-3:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters via the same
   cell-entry receptor as SARS-CoV, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme
   II (ACE2) (`Paules et al\ , JAMA,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31971553>`__). SARS-CoV-2 is
   thought to have a higher affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV.

2. ACE2 is expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, and kidneys.
   ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in
   animal models increase the expression of ACE2 (`Zheng et al, Nat Rev
   Cardiol, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32139904>`__),
   though this has not been confirmed in human studies. This has led to
   the hypothesis that ACEi and ARBs might worsen myocarditis or
   precipitate ACS. It has also been hypothesized that the upregulation
   of ACE2 is therapeutic in COVID-19 and that ARBs might be protective
   during infection (`Gurwitz D, Drug Dev Res,
   2020 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32129518>`__).

.. _recommendations-3:

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. This remains an area of investigation and it is unclear how these
   medications affect patients with COVID-19.

   a. For outpatients, we recommend **against** **discontinuing**
      outpatient ACEi/ARBs.

   b. For inpatients, we recommend **against** **routine
      discontinuation** of ACEi/ARBs, unless otherwise indicated
      (*e.g.,* acute kidney injury, hypotension, shock, etc).

      i. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association
         and Heart Failure Society of America joint statement recommends
         against discontinuing ACE-I and ARBs in patients with COVID-19
         (`Bozkurt et al, HFSA/ACC/AHA Statement Addresses Concerns Re:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
----------------------------------------------

.. _pathophysiology-4:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via ACE2. ACE2 is upregulated by ibuprofen
   in animal models, and this might contribute to increased pathology
   (see `“Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and
   Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB)”
   section <#angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-ace-i-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers-arb>`__

   2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__).

   a. Concern has been raised that NSAIDs may worsen COVID-19 disease.
      This has not been proven clinically to-date, so we cannot make a
      recommendation for or against their use at this time.

Vitamin C
---------

1. While this idea has been popular in mainstream media, there is
   currently no evidence to support low- or high-dose vitamin C in
   COVID-19 patients. There is a trial currently recruiting for
   `high-dose vitamin C trial in COVID-19 patients in
   China <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533>`__ slated to
   be complete in the fall of 2020.

   a. The use of Vitamin C as a treatment for sepsis is beyond the scope
      of this document. A 96-hour infusion of vitamin C did not
      demonstrate significant improvement of organ dysfunction, vascular
      injury or alter inflammatory markers in sepsis patients with ARDS,
      although a reduction in 28-day mortality was exhibited (Difference
      -0.17, p=0.03). (`Fowler, et al. JAMA,
      2019 <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2752063>`__\ *).*
      This study does **not** look at COVID-19 ARDS patients.

Blood Products 
--------------

Red blood cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Restrictive transfusion strategy (Hct > 21, Hgb > 7) is recommended.

   a. If hemodynamically stable, transfuse 1 unit at a time and reassess
      needs.

   b. Transfusion thresholds for pRBCs are recommended as follows:

      i.   Acute coronary syndrome: consider transfusion for Hgb < 10.

      ii.  Oncology patients: transfuse for Hgb < 7.

      iii. All others: transfuse for Hgb < 7.

2. Parsimony is encouraged given:

   a. Limited supply (blood drives are limited by social distancing).

   b. Volume overload is of particular concern in COVID patients.

      i. Randomized controlled trials of ICU patients have shown that a
         conservative transfusion strategy (Hgb > 7) is associated with
         less pulmonary edema, fewer cardiac events and no evidence of
         harm compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (`Hébert et al,
         N Engl J Med,
         1999 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9971864>`__; `Holst et
         al, N Engl J Med,
         2014 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270275>`__; `Gajic
         et al, Crit Care Med,
         2006 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16617262>`__).

3. Massive transfusion protocol, as a very limited resource, will need
   to be activated only by the ICU attending

Other blood products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In general, treat bleeding not numbers.

2. FFP or 4 factor-PCC (lower volume) should be given for active
   bleeding in the setting of known or suspected coagulation
   abnormalities.

3. For warfarin reversal, use 4 factor-PCC given longer effect and lower
   volume.

4. Platelets should be transfused for platelet count < 10K unless
   actively bleeding. Transfuse 1 unit at a time.

Blood donation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. We encourage all staff who are healthy and eligible to donate to make
   an appointment to donate blood or platelets at the Kraft Family Blood
   Donor Center at DFCI and BWH, either by phone (617.632.3206) or
   `online <https://www.dana-farber.org/how-you-can-help/get-involved/donate-blood-and-platelets/>`__.

5: Cardiac Complications
========================

Acute Cardiac Injury
--------------------

Definition and incidence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Definition:** Defined in studies as troponin > 99\ :sup:`th`
   percentile, or abnormal ECG or echocardiographic findings (`Zhou et
   al, Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).
   Non-specific study definition..

2. **Incidence**: Incidence of 7-22% in hospitalized patients with
   COVID-19 in China (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__; `Wang et al,
   JAMA, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__; `Chen et
   al, Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143>`__;
   Shi et al, JAMA Cardiology, 2020).

.. _pathophysiology-5:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The mechanism is unknown, though several have been proposed, based on
   very limited data outside of case series and reports (`Ruan et al,
   Intensive Care Med,
   2020 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__; `Hu et al,
   Eur Heart J, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300>`__;
   `Zeng et al, Preprints,
   2020 <http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1>`__)

   a. Possible direct toxicity through viral invasion into cardiac
      myocytes (*i.e.*, myocarditis)

   b. Acute coronary syndrome and demand ischemia

   c. Stress or cytokine-mediated cardiomyopathy (*i.e.,* Takotsubo’s)

Time course and prognostic implication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Troponin rise and acute cardiac injury may be late manifestations of
   COVID-19.

   a. Troponin increased rapidly from ~14 days from illness onset, after
      the onset of respiratory failure (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

   b. Among non-survivors, a steady rise in troponin I levels was
      observed throughout the disease course from day 4 of illness
      through day 22 (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

2. ACI is associated with ICU admission and mortality

   a. ACI is higher in non-survivors (59%, n=32) than survivors (1%,
      n=1) (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

   b. ACI is higher in ICU patients (22%, n=22) compared to non-ICU
      patients (2%, n=2) (`Wang et al, JAMA,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__)

Cardiovascular Testing and Consultation
---------------------------------------

Testing
~~~~~~~

1. **Troponin:**

   a. ICU patients: Check hsTrop daily and ScvO2 daily

   b. Inpatients: Check hsTrop every other day

      i. If hsTrop > 200 ng/L or ScvO2 <60%

         1. Obtain 12-lead ECG

         2. Perform point-of-care US (POCUS) if you are trained to do so

         3. If no new ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, continue
            to monitor hsTrop and ScvO2

2. **Telemetry:**

   a. Telemetry should be used for all critically-ill patients

   b. At BWH, COVID-19 intermediate-care patients also have telemetry.

   c. For hospitals, with resource-limitations, telemetry is most
      important for patients who meet AHA criteria (`Sandau et al,
      Circulation,
      2017 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28974521>`__).

3. **ECGs:**

   a. Daily ECGs are reasonable for individuals with severe COVID-19.

      i. When possible, print ECGs from the in-room monitor to minimize
         contamination of equipment

4. TTE

   a. Do not order routine TTEs on COVID-19 patients.

   b. Cardiology consult or a trained provider should perform POCUS
      (uploaded to PACS/Centricity) if:

      i.   Significant troponin elevation or decline in ScvO2/MvO2

      ii.  Shock

      iii. New heart failure (not pre-existing heart failure)

      iv.  New persistent arrhythmia

      v.   Significant ECG changes

           1. If abnormalities are identified on POCUS (e.g. new
              reduction in LVEF < 50%), a formal TTE should be obtained
              and cardiology consulted.

           2. Where possible order limited TTEs instead of full TTEs to
              conserve resources.

5. **Cardiac Imaging & Stress Testing:**

   a. Cardiac imaging, including TEE, cardiac CT, and cardiac MRI will
      be considered on a case-by-case basis in consultation with
      cardiology.

   b. Stress testing is likely not indicated in individuals with active
      COVID unless in discussion with cardiology consultation.

6. **Cardiology Consultation**

   a. The following clinical scenarios should prompt cardiology
      consultation:

      i.   Malignant and unstable arrhythmias

      ii.  A marked rise in cardiac biomarkers

      iii. Concern for myocarditis

      iv.  Concern for ACS, particularly ST-elevation pattern on ECG

      v.   New heart failure

      vi.  Undifferentiated or cardiogenic shock

Arrhythmias
-----------

Incidence
~~~~~~~~~

1. Case series report the occurrence of unspecified arrhythmias in 17%
   of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=23 of 138), with higher
   rate in ICU patients (44%, n=16) compared to non-ICU patients (7%,
   n=7) (`Wang et al, JAMA,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__).

2. There are anecdotal reports of VT and VF as a late manifestation of
   COVID-19. No specific published findings were identified.

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Telemetry, 12-lead EKG, cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, TFT

2. ScvO2 if central line present

3. POCUS to assess LV and RV function with uploaded images

4. Obtain formal TTE and consider cardiology consultation if
   abnormalities of any of the above

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter

   a. Beta blockade if no evidence of heart failure or shock

   b. If significant heart failure or borderline BPs, use amiodarone.
      There is no known increased concern for amiodarone lung toxicity

   c. If unstable, synchronized DCCV with 200 Joules biphasic

2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)

   a. Unstable/pulseless: initiate ACLS

   b. Stable:

      i.  **Cardiology consult** (may represent evolving myocardial
          involvement)

      ii. Amiodarone 150mg IV x 1 or lidocaine 100mg IV x 1

Acute Coronary Syndromes
------------------------

.. _incidence-1:

Incidence 
~~~~~~~~~

1. There is no current available data on the incidence of ACS in COVID.
   However, we presume that due to the presence of ACE2 receptors on the
   endothelium, and the known increased risk of ACS in influenza that
   there is a possible increased incidence of ACS among COVID-19
   patients.

   a. The incidence of ACS is about 6 times as high within seven days of
      an influenza diagnosis than during the control interval -
      incidence ratio 6.05 (95% CI, 3.86 to 9.50) (`Kwong et al, NEJM,
      2018 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365305>`__).

.. _workup-1:

Workup 
~~~~~~

1. Elevated troponin/ECG changes alone may not be able to discriminate
   between:

   a. Coronary thrombosis

   b. Demand-related ischemia

   c. Myocarditis

   d. Toxic myocardial injury (e.g. sepsis)

2. Determination of ACS will rely on all evidence available:

   a. Symptoms (if able to communicate): New dyspnea, chest pain,
      anginal equivalents

   b. Regional ECG changes

   c. Rate of change of Troponin changes (*i.e.*, steep rise suggests
      ACS)

   d. Echo findings (*e.g.*, new RWMA): When in doubt, request a
      cardiology consult.

3. **When in doubt, request a cardiology consultation**

.. _management-1:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Medical management of ACS should be **coordinated with cardiology**

   a. Treat with full dose aspirin, clopidogrel (if not bleeding),
      heparin, oxygen (if hypoxemic), statin, nitrates (if
      hypertensive), and opioids (if persistent pain during medical
      management).

   b. Beta blockers should be used with caution given possible
      concomitant myocarditis/decompensated heart failure.

2. As of the time of this writing, the cath lab will take COVID-19
   patients, even if ventilated.

   a. If resources become constrained and door-to-balloon time is no
      longer adequate, cardiology may decide to use lytic medications
      for COVID-19 STEMI patients in lieu of PCI.

Pericarditis and Myocarditis
----------------------------

.. _incidence-2:

Incidence
~~~~~~~~~

1. Myocarditis and pericarditis are potential manifestations of COVID-19
   and source of Acute Cardiac Injury, based on case reports/case series
   (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__; `Zeng et al,
   Preprints,
   2020 <http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1>`__; `Hu et
   al, Eur Heart J,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300>`__)

2. However, there is currently no evidence of proven pericarditis or
   myocarditis, either by biopsy or cMRI.

.. _workup-2:

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Likely no role for endomyocardial biopsy

2. cMRI should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with a **cardiology
   consult team**.

.. _management-2:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Supportive for heart failure and direct viral treatments

2. The use of anti-inflammatory medications such as Colchicine and
   Ibuprofen should also be discussed with the cardiology consult team
   as this literature is evolving.

6: Shock: Septic, Cardiogenic, and Cytokine
===========================================

Undifferentiated Shock in COVID
-------------------------------

.. _overview-1:

Overview
~~~~~~~~

1. **Definition:**

   a. Acute onset of new and sustained hypotension (MAP < 65 or SBP <
      90) with signs of hypoperfusion requiring IVF or vasopressors to
      maintain adequate blood pressure

2. **Time course:**

   a. Patients rarely present in shock on admission

      i. Natural history seems to favor the development of shock after
         multiple days of critical illness.

3. **Etiology:**

   a. The range of reasons for shock is wide and more variable than for
      most patients and includes:

      i.   Cardiogenic shock

      ii.  Secondary bacterial infection

      iii. Cytokine storm

.. _workup-3:

Workup 
~~~~~~

1. Assess for severity of **end organ damage**:

   a. UOP, mental status, lactate, BUN/creatinine, electrolytes, LFTs

2. Obtain a **FULL infectious/ septic workup**, which includes all of
   the following:

   a. Labs: CBC with differential. Note that most COVID patients are
      lymphopenic (83%). However, new leukocytosis can occur and
      left-shift can be used as a part of clinical picture (`Guan et al,
      N Engl J Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109013>`__). Two sets
      of blood cultures, LFTs (for cholangitis/acalculous
      cholecystitis), urinalysis (with reflex to culture), sputum
      culture (if safely obtained via inline suctioning, do not perform
      bronchoscopy or sputum induction), procalcitonin at 0 and 48h (do
      not withhold early antibiotics on the basis of procalcitonin\ *),*
      urine Strep and legionella antigens

   b. Portable CXR (avoid CT unless absolutely necessary)

   c. Full skin exam

3. Assess for **cardiogenic shock**

   a. Assess extremities: warm or cool on exam

   b. Assess patient volume status: JVP, CVP, edema, CXR

   c. Assess pulse pressure: If < 25% of the SBP, correlates highly with
      a reduction in cardiac index to less than 2.2 with a sensitivity
      of 91% and a specificity of 83% (`Stevenson and Perloff, JAMA,
      1989 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913385>`__)

   d. Perform POCUS if trained to do so and upload to PACS/Centricity

      i. For TTE protocols see `“Cardiac Complications of COVID-19”
         chapter <#_6zfga8b63w2s>`__.

   e. Labs: Obtain an SCV02 or MV02 if the patient has central access,
      troponin x2, NT proBNP, A1c, lipid profile, TSH

   f. EKG (and telemetry)

   g. Calculate estimated Fick Cardiac Output

      i. MDcalc online calculators: `Fick
         CO <http://www.mdcalc.com/cardiac-output-ficks-formula>`__,
         `BSA <http://www.mdcalc.com/body-mass-index-bmi-body-surface-area-bsa>`__

   h. Obtain cardiology consultation if any suspicion of cardiogenic
      shock

4. Assess for **other causes of shock**:

   a. Vasoplegia:

      i. Run medication list for recent cardiosuppressive medications,
         vasodilatory agents, antihypertensives

   b. Adrenal insufficiency:

      i. Unless high pretest probability of adrenal insufficiency, we
         recommend against routine cortisone stimulation testing

   c. Obstruction:

      i.   PE (given the elevated risk of thrombosis)

      ii.  Tamponade (given elevated risk of pericarditis)

      iii. Obstruction from PEEP

   d. Cytokine storm (see `“Cytokine Activation Syndrome”
      section <#cytokine-activation-syndrome>`__ in this chapter below)

   e. Allergic reactions to recent medications

   f. Neurogenic shock is uncommon in this context

   g. Hypovolemia:

      i.   Bleeding

      ii.  Insensible losses from fever

      iii. Diarrhea/vomiting

Differentiating Shock

Septic Shock and Secondary Infections 
-------------------------------------

.. _incidence-3:

Incidence
~~~~~~~~~

1. The reported rates of sepsis and septic shock are not reported
   consistently in currently available case series

   a. Secondary bacterial infections are reported:

      i.   20% of non-survivors (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
           2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__)

      ii.  16% of non-survivors (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
           2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__)

      iii. 12-19% In H1N1 epidemic (`MacIntyre et al, BMC Infect Dis,
           2018 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526505>`__)

   b. Concurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia has been reported in at least
      one case (possibly due to lymphopenia)

.. _management-3:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Antibiosis:**

   a. Early empiric antibiotics should be initiated within 1 hour (see
      `“Antibiotic Stewardship” section <#antibiotics>`__ within
      `“COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials”
      chapter <#_kx686gedgtzg>`__)

2. **Pressors and Fluid Management:**

   a. **Goal MAP > 65mmHg**

      i. While there is emerging data that lower MAP thresholds may be
         beneficial, we recommend following this threshold for now.

   b. **Pressors**

      i.  Start Norepinephrine while determining the etiology of
          undifferentiated shock

      ii. Unless new evidence emerges, standard choices for distributive
          shock (*i.e.*, norepinephrine then vasopressin) are
          recommended, with high vigilance for the development of
          cardiogenic shock, addressed in the next section

   c. **Conservative fluid management:**

      i.   **Do not give conventional 30cc/kg resuscitation**

           1. COVID-19 clinical reports indicate the majority of
              patients present with respiratory failure without shock.
              ARDS is mediated in part by pulmonary capillary leak, and
              randomized controlled trials of ARDS indicate that a
              conservative fluid strategy is protective in this setting
              (`Grissom et al, Crit Care Med,
              2015 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463>`__;
              `Famous et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med,
              2017 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27513822>`__;
              `Silversides et al, Int Care Med,
              2017 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734109>`__)

           2. Conservative fluid management is also part of the most
              recent WHO guidelines. `WHO, COVID-19 Interim guidance,
              March
              2020 <http://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected>`__).

      ii.  **Instead, give 250-500cc IVF and assess in 15-30 minutes**
           for:

           1. Increase > 2 in CVP

           2. Increase in MAP or decrease in pressor requirement

              a. Use isotonic crystalloids; Lactated Ringer’s solution
                 is preferred where possible. Avoid hypotonic fluids,
                 starches, or colloids

      iii. **Repeat 250-500cc IVF boluses; Use dynamic measures of fluid
           responsiveness**

           1. Pulse Pressure Variation: can be calculated in
              mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmia; PPV
              >12% is sensitive and specific for volume responsiveness

           2. Straight Leg Raise: raise legs to 45° w/ supine torso for
              at least one minute. A change in pulse pressure of > 12%
              has sensitivity of 60% & specificity of 85% for fluid
              responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients; less
              accurate if spontaneously breathing

           3. Ultrasound evaluation of IVC collapsibility should only be
              undertaken by trained personnel to avoid contamination of
              ultrasound

           4. For further guidance, Conservative Fluid Management
              protocols are available from from FACCT Lite trial
              (`Grissom et al, Crit Care Med,
              2015 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599463>`__).

      iv.  **Corticosteroids**

           1. See “Systemic Corticosteroids” section

           2. Stress dose hydrocortisone should still be considered in
              patients on > 2 pressors\ *.*

Cardiogenic Shock
-----------------

Incidence and clinical course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Etiology:** See `“Acute Cardiac Injury”
   section <#acute-cardiac-injury>`__.

   i. Mechanism is unknown, potentially direct viral toxicity, ACS, or
      inflammatory cardiomyopathy

2. **Incidence:**

   a. Heart failure or cardiogenic shock **was observed**

      i.  In 23% (n=44 of 191) of hospitalized patients in one case
          series (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

          1. There were higher rates in non-survivors (52%, n=28)
             compared to survivors (12%, n=16),

      ii. In 33% of patients admitted to an ICU in Washington State 33%
          (n=7 of 21) (`Arentz et al, JAMA,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191259>`__).

          1. These patients tended to be older with more comorbidities
             and had a high mortality (11 of the 21 died).

3. **Prognostic implication:**

   a. Heart failure or myocardial damage **contributed to death**

      i. In 39% (n=29) of deaths in a series of 68 patients in Wuhan.
         Most (n=22 of 29) had concomitant respiratory failure (`Ruan et
         al, Intensive Care Med,
         2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__).

4. **Time course:**

   a. Cardiogenic shock may present late in the course of illness even
      after improvement of respiratory symptoms, and manifest as a
      precipitous clinical deterioration in the setting of an acute
      decline in LVEF (see `“Acute Cardiac Injury”
      section <#acute-cardiac-injury>`__\ **)**

.. _workup-4:

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Significant concern for cardiogenic shock if any of the following are
   present with evidence of hypoperfusion (*e.g.*, elevated lactate):

   a. Elevated NT-proBNP, or

   b. CvO2 < 60% (PvO2 < 35 mm Hg), or

   c. Echocardiogram with depressed LV and/or RV function

2. Rule out ACS and complete the initial work up as described in
   `“Cardiac Complications” chapter <#_6zfga8b63w2s>`__.

3. Ongoing monitoring:

   a. Labs: Trend troponins to peak, SCvO2 (obtained by upper body CVC)
      or MvO2 q8-12h or with clinical change, Lactate q4-6h, LFTs daily
      (for hepatic congestion)

   b. Daily EKGs or prn with clinical deterioration

   c. Trend troponin to peak

4. All cardiogenic shock cases require **cardiovascular medicine
   consult**

   a. PA catheters may be placed bedside by experienced providers, with
      preference for use only in mixed shock or complex cases with
      cardiology guidance

.. _management-4:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Close collaboration with the **cardiovascular medicine consultation
   service** is recommended.

   a. Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000,
      SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2

      i. Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other
         parameters

   b. How to achieve goals:

      i.   Continue titration of norepinephrine gtt for goal MAP 65-75

      ii.  Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD > 25

      iii. Initiate inotropic support:

           1. Dobutamine gtt for SCvO2 < 60%, CI < 2.2 and MAP > 65.
              Start at 2mcg/kg/min. Up-titrate by 1-2mcg/kg/min every
              30-60 minutes for goal parameters. Alternative strategies
              should be considered once dose exceeds 5mcg/kg/min.
              Maximum dose is 10mcg/kg/min.

      iv.  Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium
           channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued.

Mechanical Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Patients who experience the following should prompt an immediate call
   to the cardiovascular medicine consult service for consideration of
   mechanical support:

   a. Dobutamine gtt at 5mcg/kg/min (or unable to tolerate dobutamine
      due to tachyarrhythmias) and ScvO2 < 60% or CI < 2.2

   b. Lactate > 4 after medical therapy

2. The criteria for ECMO and other mechanical cardiovascular support
   varies among centers and are difficult to develop even under typical
   circumstances. The unclear trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic makes
   these evaluations even more difficult.

   a. BWH ECMO and Cardiovascular Medicine guidelines are in development
      and will be linked once available.

   b. For the purposes of general education, a **hypothetical** set of
      inclusion criteria for ECMO or MCS could cover:

      i.    Younger age

      ii.   Expected life expectancy >6 months pre-hospitalization

      iii.  No evidence of solid or liquid malignancy

      iv.   Able to tolerate anticoagulation

      v.    Platelets >50,000

      vi.   Absence of severe peripheral arterial disease

      vii.  No evidence of irreversible neurological injury

      viii. Able to perform ADLs at baseline prior to illness

      ix.   Cannot have profound respiratory failure (defined as
            requiring prone ventilation at time of consult for MCS or
            having PaO2:FiO2 ratio < 150) (for MCS other than ECMO)

Cytokine Activation Syndrome
----------------------------

.. _pathophysiology-6:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine
   activation syndrome and secondary HLH (`Mehta et al\ , Lancet,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192578>`__).

   a. Patients who had cytokine activation developed rapid progression
      to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure (`Chen et al\ , Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143>`__)

2. Pathophysiology:

   a. Neutrophil activation likely contributes to the pathogenesis of
      cytokine storm and ARDS (`Wu et al\ , JAMA Intern Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__). `Wu et
      al <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__ found that
      COVID-19 confirmed patients with ARDS have higher neutrophil
      counts, average 7.04 (95% CI: 3.98 to 10.12) vs. those without
      ARDS, average 3.06 (2.03 to 5.56)

   b. Similar patterns of cytokine storm and ARDS have been seen with
      SARS, MERS (`Kim et al\ , J Korean Med Sci,
      2016 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709848>`__)

   c. Other studies have suggested that increased proinflammatory
      cytokines in the serum are associated with pulmonary injury in
      SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (`Wong et al\ , Clin Exp Immunol,
      2004 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030519>`__)

.. _workup-5:

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Suspect if clinical deterioration with shock and multiorgan failure.

   a. CBC with diff, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, ferritin, liver
      function test, triglycerides, c-reactive protein (CRP) (`Ruan et
      al, Intensive Care Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__)

      i.  CRP seems to correlate with disease severity and prognosis of
          COVID-19 (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452>`__; `Young
          et al\ , JAMA,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125362>`__)

      ii. An HScore (`MDcalc online
          calculator <http://www.mdcalc.com/hscore-reactive-hemophagocytic-syndrome>`__)
          may be helpful in estimating the probability of secondary HLH
          in these patients

.. _management-5:

Management 
~~~~~~~~~~

1. If high suspicion, discuss with ID about the use of IVIG, steroids,
   cytokine blockade, particularly IL-6 pathway and perhaps IL-1 (see
   `“Anti-IL6 Agents”
   section <#anti-il6-agents-tocilizumab-siltuximab-sarilumab>`__ within
   `“COVID-19 Therapies and Clinical Trials”
   chapter <#_kx686gedgtzg>`__). While steroids have been implicated
   with worse lung injury and outcomes, they may be beneficial in the
   hyperinflammatory state.

7: Cardiac Arrest
=================

Preparation 
-----------

Minimizing Healthcare Worker Risk of Exposure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Code Responses to COVID-19 patients are high-risk events for
   healthcare worker exposure due to the aerosolization that occurs with
   chest compressions and intubation

   a. Use PPE:

      i. CDC guidelines recommend N95 respirator, face shield, gown and
         gloves be used by all code responders during code events (`CDC
         Guidelines,
         2020 <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html>`__)
         as well as Face Shield, Gown and Gloves).

   b. Minimize personnel:

      i. Use an automated compression device where available to minimize
         personnel.

   c. Prepare code equipment:

      i. To limit transmission of virus while passing meds/supplies into
         the patient’s room from the code cart, consider creating Code
         Bags inside the Code Cart pre-packed with necessary code meds
         (Epinephrine, Bicarbonate, Calcium etc.) and IV/lab supplies.

Early goals of care conversations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To avoid unnecessary codes in patients with an irreversible
   underlying condition, patients who are at high-risk for acute
   decompensation should be identified early and appropriate steps
   should be taken to confirm code status and initiate early goals of
   care conversations with the patient and family.

Code Management 
---------------

1. **Efforts should be made to minimize the total number of Code
   responders in the room to 7-8**.

   a. Code responders inside the patient’s room who should don full PPE
      prior to entering the patient’s room:

      i.   Code Leader (1)

      ii.  Code RN (1)

      iii. Scribe RN (Primary RN or NIC) (1)

      iv.  Respiratory Therapist (1)

      v.   Anesthesiologist (1)

      vi.  2 Chest Compressors, resting compressor holds femoral pulse
           (2)

      vii. If needed for surgical procedures, Surgical Responder (1)

   b. Code responders outside the patient’s room should not don PPE
      unless called upon in the room:

      i.   Additional unit nurses (2-3) (supplies, meds from omnicell,
           code cart)

      ii.  Code Cart

      iii. Pharmacist (1)

      iv.  Additional medical resident/MDs (2) (Medical resident on
           computer outside the room placing orders, calling consults,
           and providing code leader with patient information)

      v.   Additional Code Responders (3-4) Surgery and Anesthesia team
           if not needed in the room

      vi.  Security

      vii. Observer (for PPE observation)

2. **Circulation**

   a. Until a definitive airway is obtained, compression-only CPR should
      be performed. Multiple studies have shown that compression-only
      CPR is non-inferior to standard CPR `(Svensson et al, NEJM,
      2010). <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0908991>`__

   b. If patient has shockable rhythm (VF/VT), defibrillate as soon as
      possible.

3. **Airway**

   a. **Initial Airway Management, Prior to Intubation:**

      i.   Prior to securing a definitive airway, oxygen should be
           applied via a non-rebreather mask at 15L/min without
           humidification

      ii.  Avoid BVM ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, and
           non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP) to minimize
           aerosolized virus `(Cheung, Lancet Resp Med,
           2020 <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30084-9/fulltext>`__;
           `Tran et al, PLoS One,
           2012) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22563403?dopt=Abstract>`__.

      iii. If passive oxygen is not available, place a surgical
           face-mask and a blanket over the patient’s face prior to
           chest compressions.

      iv.  If the patient does not have a shockable rhythm, proceed with
           Rapid Sequence Intubation as early as possible to limit
           aerosolization

   b. **Endotracheal Intubation**

      i.   Endotracheal intubation is the procedure that subjects the
           rescuer to the highest risk of infection during
           resuscitation. To maximize the success rate for intubation,
           airway interventions should be carried out by experienced
           individuals and chest compressions should be stopped
           `(Cheung, Lancet Resp Med,
           2020) <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30084-9/fulltext>`__.
           This may deviate from usual cardiac arrest care leading to a
           pause in chest compressions, however this is acceptable to
           maintain the safety of code responders. Please see
           “intubation” chapter for more details.

      ii.  Chest compressions should resume once the endotracheal tube
           (ETT) cuff is inflated and the ETT is connected to the
           ventilator.

      iii. If the pause in chest compressions is excessive and
           endotracheal intubation does not seem likely, consider LMA or
           other extraglottic airway device.

      iv.  Code responders should distance themselves from the head of
           the bed during the intubation procedure (6 ft distance).

      v.   Continuous capnography device should be used to monitor
           ventilation `(Cheung, Lancet Resp Med,
           2020) <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30084-9/fulltext>`__.

      vi.  Depending on institutional policies, anesthesia and
           respiratory therapy may don higher levels of PPE including
           PAPR hoods for the intubation procedure.

4. **Etiologies to Consider**

   a. Data from a `retrospective study in
      Wuhan <https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-020-05991-x>`__
      (`Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med,
      2020 <https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-020-05991-x>`__)
      revealed cause of death to be:

      i.   Respiratory failure (53%)

      ii.  Heart failure with respiratory failure (33%)

      iii. Myocardial damage (7%)

      iv.  Unknown cause (7%)

   b. It is important to attempt to identify and treat reversible causes
      (5H’s, 5T’s) before stopping the code.

5. **Terminating Resuscitative Efforts**

   a. Avoid prolonged resuscitation if there is no easily reversible
      etiology identified.

   b. No one factor alone, or in combination, is predictive of outcome
      during cardiac arrest, however it is reasonable to stop
      resuscitation efforts if return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
      has not been achieved within 30 minutes.

   c. In intubated patients, failure to achieve an ETCO2 of greater than
      10 mm Hg by waveform capnography after 20 minutes of CPR should be
      considered as one component of a multimodal approach to decide
      when to end resuscitative efforts (`Mancini et al, Circulation,
      2015 <https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/pubmed/26472991>`__)

6. **Post-Resuscitation Care**

   a. Dispose of, or clean, all equipment used during CPR. Any work
      surfaces used for airway/resuscitation equipment will also need to
      be cleaned.

   b. After the resuscitation has ended adhere to strict doffing
      procedure to limit exposure.

   c. If ROSC is achieved, provide usual post-resuscitation care
      consistent with current recommended guidelines including targeted
      temperature management (`Donnino et al, Circulation,
      2015 <https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/cir.0000000000000313>`__).

8: Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations
============================================

Thrombotic Disease
------------------

.. _incidence-4:

Incidence 
~~~~~~~~~

1. Unclear incidence, though case reports suggest there may be increased
   venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients (`Xie et al, Radiol
   Cardiothoracic Imaging,
   2020 <http://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200067>`__)

.. _pathophysiology-7:

Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The mechanism for VTE are unknown and likely multifactorial:

   a. Systemic inflammatory response as seen in sepsis

   b. Stasis/critical illness

   c. Possibly direct endothelial damage from viral injury/ACE2 binding

2. Colleagues from Wuhan have reported finding microthrombi in pulmonary
   vasculature on autopsy (`Luo et al, Preprints, 2020
   preprint <http://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0407/v2>`__),
   which could contribute to local V/Q mismatch or hydrostatic changes
   causing edema. However these mechanisms remain entirely hypothetical.

   a. One theory: SARS-CoV Spike protein can be cleaved by FXa and FIIa.
      Cleavage of the Spike protein activates it which promotes
      infectivity. By extension, it is hypothesized that anticoagulation
      might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. There is a small case series
      suggesting dipyridamole may be useful, though anticoagulation and
      antiplatelet agents require further investigation prior to being
      used therapeutically (`Liu et al, medRxiv, 2020
      preprint <http://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557>`__; `Lin et
      al, Emerging Microbes & Infections,
      2020 <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/22221751.2020.1746199?needAccess=true&>`__).

.. _management-6:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Initiate prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for all COVID-19
   patients unless otherwise contraindicated

   a. If CrCl > 30: Lovenox 40 mg SC daily

   b. If CrCl < 30 or AKI: Heparin 5000 units SC TID

   c. Hold if Platelets <30,000 or bleeding, start TEDs and SCDs

2. If the patient is on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or Warfarin
   for Afib or VTE, switch to full dose anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH, as
   indicated based on renal function or clinical scenario).

3. While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in some
   severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan given the microthrombi in pulmonary
   vasculature (see “Pathophysiology” above), our interpretation of the
   data is that the risks outweigh the benefits at this time, unless
   documented DVT or PE.

.. _prognosis-1:

Prognosis 
~~~~~~~~~

1. Higher D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ dysfunction
   syndrome and poorer prognosis (`Wang et al, JAMA,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__; `Zhou et al,
   Lancet, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
--------------------------------------------

Incidence/pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Limited data: 16 of 183 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had DIC (`Tang
   et al, J Thromb Haemost,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213>`__).

2. Laboratory changes in coagulation parameters and FDP track with
   multi-organ dysfunction (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

.. _time-course-1:

Time course 
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into hospital admission (`Tang
   et al, J Thromb Haemost,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213>`__).

.. _workup-6:

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Identify and treat underlying condition

2. ISTH DIC score (`MDcalc online
   calculator <http://www.mdcalc.com/isth-criteria-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic>`__):
   If score < 5, no DIC; recalculate in 1-2 days

3. Elevated PT/PTT and D-dimer correlate with worse prognosis: trend
   PT/INR, PTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen every 3 days until discharge or
   death

.. _management-7:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. If not bleeding, supportive care:

   a. If fibrinogen < 150: FFP, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen
      concentrate (RiaSTAP or Fibryga)

   b. RiaSTAP and Fibryga are less volume, but dose must be discussed
      with HAT/pharmacy

2. Transfuse platelets if < 30K

   a. Consider holding anticoagulation if the patient requires blood
      products for supportive care, though clinician should weigh risks
      and benefits.

3. If bleeding, give blood products:

   a. For elevated PT/PTT and bleeding, use FFP or 4F-PCC (KCentra is
      less volume, but must discuss dose with HAT/pharmacy)

   b. Hold anticoagulation for active bleeding.

4. Start systemic anticoagulation only if:

   a. Overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot (*i.e.*,
      purpura fulminans)

   b. There has been no mortality benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation
      in DIC (`Levi et al, Blood,
      2018 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29255070>`__).

.. _prognosis-2:

Prognosis 
~~~~~~~~~

1. DIC is associated with worse survival in COVID-19 patients. Out of
   183 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 71% of non-survivors had DIC (ISTH
   score ≥ 5; `MDcalc online
   calculator <http://www.mdcalc.com/isth-criteria-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic>`__)
   compared to 0.6% of survivors (`Tang et al, J Thromb Haemost,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073213>`__).

9: Renal Manifestations 
=======================

Acute Kidney Injury
-------------------

Incidence and Pathophysiology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Incidence of AKI in COVID-19 varies widely, but estimates range from
   2.1% to 29%.

2. Likely that the most common pathophysiology will be acute tubular
   necrosis (ATN) driven by shock (`Xianghong et al\ , Natl Med J China,
   2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145717>`__) and in some
   cases cytokine storm.

   a. Areas for future research: Some have hypothesized that there could
      direct cellular injury by the virus via angiotensin converting
      enzyme II (ACE2). COVID-19 uses ACE2 for cell entry. ACE2 is
      expressed in proximal renal tubules more than glomeruli (`Fan et
      al\ , medRxiv,
      2020 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418>`__).

.. _workup-7:

Workup
~~~~~~

1. Monitor Creatinine at least daily

   a. Studies find variable onset of AKI, from 7 days (`Cheng et al,
      medRxiv, 2020
      preprint <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242>`__) to 15
      days after illness onset (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__). Onset of
      AKI more rapid and severe in patients with underlying CKD (`Cheng
      et al, medRxiv, 2020
      preprint <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242>`__)

2. If evidence of rising BUN and/or creatinine, order urinalysis

   a. Patients may present with proteinuria (44%), hematuria (26.9%)

.. _management-8:

Management 
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Consult ICU nephrology early at the first sign of renal injury for
   all COVID-19 confirmed patients

   a. Do not wait until need for RRT (renal replacement
      therapy)/dialysis for consultation.

   b. At this time, *all confirmed COVID-19 patients* are covered by ICU
      nephrology, not general nephrology

2. Managing AKI:

   a. Minimize nephrotoxic agents

   b. Give judicious fluids for suspected prerenal insults, but discuss
      with renal if any ambiguity (see `“Shock”
      chapter <#_dpe5gr1hwjp>`__ for conservative fluid recommendations)

Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Estimates for RRT range from 1 to 5% of hospitalized patients. Among
   critically ill patients, need for CRRT ranges from 5 to 23%

   a. Few studies have reported outcomes of RRT. One case series
      reported that out of 191 patients, 10 received CRRT, and all 10
      died (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

2. Renal will be coordinating RRT continuation and initiation

   a. Indications for dialysis in COVID-19 patients are the same as the
      indications for all patients.

3. ICU nephrology will determine the need, timing, and modality of renal
   replacement on a case-by-case basis.

.. _prognosis-3:

Prognosis
~~~~~~~~~

1. Increased serum creatine, BUN, AKI, proteinuria, or hematuria are
   each independent risk factors for in-hospital death (`Cheng et al,
   medRxiv, 2020
   preprint <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242>`__)

   a. In two other studies, non-survivors had higher BUN and creatinine
      and higher rates of AKI (`Wang et al, JAMA,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570>`__\ *;* `Yang
      et al\ , Lancet Respir Med,
      2020) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105632>`__.

   b. Another study found that higher BUN and creatinine are associated
      with progression to ARDS, and higher BUN (though not creatinine)
      is associated with death (HR 1.06-1.20) (`Wu et al\ , JAMA Intern
      Med, 2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__).

   c. In SARS, AKI correlated with poor prognosis and 91.7% of patients
      with AKI died (vs 8.8% without AKI, p < 0.0001) (`Chu et al\ ,
      Kidney Int,
      2005 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673319>`__).

Liver disease
-------------

.. _overview-2:

Overview
~~~~~~~~

1. **Incidence:**

   a. The incidence of direct hepatic injury is confounded by
      pre-existing liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, and shock

      i. The only reported post-mortem liver biopsy from a patient with
         COVID-19 showed only microvesicular steatosis, a common finding
         in sepsis

   b. Up to 53% of patients have abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
      and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [`Zhang et al\ , Lancet
      Gastroenterol Hepatol,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145190>`__].

      i. Given often elevated CK, this may also represent a myositis
         similar to that observed in severe influenza infections
         [`Bangash et al, Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,
         2020 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30084-4>`__].

   c. Bilirubins and alkaline phosphatase tend to be spared

      i. 54% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at a single center in
         China had elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).

2. Clinical course:

   a. In general, liver injury in mild COVID-19 disease is transient and
      self-resolving. However, liver injury correlates with severity

      i.  ALT > 40 is associated with higher odds of in-hospital death
          (`Zhou et al, Lancet,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076>`__).

      ii. AST is associated with progression to ARDS but not death;
          total bilirubin is associated with both progression to ARDS
          and death (`Wu et al\ , JAMA Intern Med,
          2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167524>`__).

   b. Acute liver failure has not been reported [`Ong et al, BMJ,
      2020 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321051>`__].

3. **Pathophysiology:**

   a. Possible mechanisms of liver injury include:

      i.   Direct liver injury (viral hepatitis)

           1. In SARS direct liver injury is seen in up to 60% of
              patients. Liver biopsies from 3 patients with SARS showed
              mild to moderate lobular inflammation, apoptosis, and
              prominent mitotic activity of hepatocytes [`Chau et al,
              Hepatology, 2004 <https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.20111>`__].

           2. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed within the biliary
              tree but not in hepatocytes [`Chai et al, BioRxiv,
              2020 <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.931766>`__].

      ii.  Drug hepatotoxicity

      iii. Hepatic congestion (impaired venous return and elevated RAP
           associated with high levels of PEEP)

      iv.  Cytokine/ immune effects

           1. Other respiratory viruses produce similar elevations of
              LFTs, thought to involve intrahepatic cytotoxic T cells
              and Kupffer cells.[`Bangash et al, Lancet Gastroenterol
              Hepatol,
              2020 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30084-4>`__].

      v.   Shock

.. _workup-8:

Workup 
~~~~~~

1. Baseline GGT, CK, LDH, LFT’s, INR

2. If normal LFTs on presentation, monitor LFTs every third day

   a. If on hepatotoxic medications, monitor more frequently in
      conjunction with pharmacy.

   b. If starting Lopinavir/Ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, monitor
      LFTs daily.

3. Workup for other etiologies of liver injury with RUQUS, doppler
   ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, etc., as clinically indicated.

.. _management-9:

Management
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Consult GI/Hepatology if concerned for acute liver failure (defined
   as severe liver injury with elevated bilirubin, INR >1.5, and
   encephalopathy).

2. Review medication list for all possible offending agents and
   discontinue if possible.

3. N-Acetyl-Cysteine is not recommended at this time due to significant
   volume load.

   a. Chinese studies refer to giving “liver protective drugs” in case
      of severe liver injury but we recommend against this for now.

12: Oncology Patients 
=====================

General Management
------------------

1.  **Data:**

    a. As of March 16, 2020, there are no available published data
       specific to COVID-19 management in oncologic or immunosuppressed
       patients.

2.  **Oncology Consultation/Coverage:**

    a. For established DFCI patients, oncology consultation and guidance
       is provided by each patient’s primary oncologist (or coverage).

    b. Contact primary oncologist via page, not the general pager.

3.  **Prognosis:**

    a. Many patients have reasonable or even good prognosis with current
       therapies. Do not assume a prognosis, involve outpatient
       attending.

4.  **Meds:**

    a. Check in Epic medications tab and in “Research: Active” tab.

5.  **Workup:**

    a. Labs:

       i.  Weekly glucan/galactomannan in neutropenic/transplant
           patients.

       ii. Specific patient populations may require additional
           monitoring (such as CMV, EBV monitoring in transplant
           patients – ask outpatient team).

6.  **Exam**:

    a. Examine catheters (port, CVC, others) daily.

    b. Avoid rectal exams in neutropenic patients, but examine the
       perirectal area if symptoms or persistent fevers.

       i. Do not give per rectum therapies to neutropenic patients.

    c. In patients with Heme Malignancy or SCT: Findings are more subtle
       or absent in neutropenic and immune suppressed patients. Examine
       catheters daily. Avoid rectal exam.

7.  **Pain management:**

    a. Patients with cancer-related pain may have high opiate needs at
       baseline. Opiates should not be stopped but type may need to be
       adjusted in the setting of respiratory failure, renal injury, or
       liver injury.

       i. Consider Pain / Palliative Care consult

8.  **Goals of Care:**

    a. Involve primary team whenever possible (recognizing that in
       critical/emergent situations may not be possible).

9.  **Anticoagulation:**

    a. Patients with solid tumors are at very high risk of thrombosis
       but at lower risk of infection than most heme malignancy
       patients.

    b. Thrombosis prophylaxis for all unless contraindicated

       i.   Hold pharmacologic prophylaxis if platelet count < 30K, use
            pneumoboots

       ii.  Both COVID-19 infection and malignancy increase thrombotic
            risk, particularly with solid tumors.

       iii. See `“Thrombotic Disease” section <#thrombotic-disease>`__
            within `“Thrombotic and Coagulation Manifestations”
            chapter <#_5s70bzlr4ojz>`__ for guidelines on both
            prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation.

10. **Transfusions:**

    a. Blood bank reviews orders and will release appropriate products
       (*i.e.*, irradiated, leukoreduced, etc).

    b. See “Blood Transfusions” section for additional details

       i.   RBC transfusion if Hgb < 7 or Hct < 21.

       ii.  Platelet transfusion if Platelets < 10K. Higher transfusion
            goals if needed for procedures or if active bleeding:

            1. Platelet count > 20K if mild bleeding (*i.e.*, epistaxis,
               line oozing) or if patient has rigors.

            2. Platelet count > 50K if more serious bleeding; may be
               higher for CNS bleeding or neurosurgery required.

       iii. Cryoprecipitate transfusion if fibrinogen < 100.

       iv.  FFP transfusion if procedure needed (INR of FFP = ~1.4).

Febrile Neutropenia
-------------------

1. **Definition:**

   a. ANC < 500 cells/mm3 AND T ≥ 101F or T ≥ 100.5 for 1hr

2. **Workup:**

   a. Blood cultures from peripheral (ideally two sets), and each lumen
      of central line (label clearly); UA/sed with urine culture (UA may
      not be as informative with neutropenia); glucan and galactomannan
      (if not checked recently), sputum if able; CXR

      i.   Continue DAILY blood cultures while febrile.

      ii.  Monitor serum galactomannan and 1-3-beta glucan once weekly.

      iii. Any positive glucan or galactomannan prompts ID consult.

3. **Initial Empiric Antibiotics:**

   a. GNRs: Ceftazidime OR Cefepime

      i. Alternatives: Piperacillin-tazobactam (2nd line) or meropenem
         (3rd line).

   b. GPCs: add Vancomycin if hemodynamically unstable, or if MRSA
      pneumonia or catheter-associated infection is suspected. Check
      dosing with pharmacy if able.

4. **Removal of lines:**

   a. Catheter removal should be discussed if associated infection is
      suspected - involve primary oncologist and/or ID team to weigh
      risks and benefits, given that not all lines require removal.

5. **Persistent Neutropenic Fever:**

   a. If fever persists x3 days despite antibiotics

      i.  Micafungin 100mg IV daily

      ii. Consideration of further imaging even if patient appears
          stable (discuss with oncology / ID).

6. **Antiinfective course:**

   a. Anti-Infectives should be continued until the patient has met all
      of these criteria:

      i.   clinically improved, and

      ii.  has been afebrile for 48h, and

      iii. has been non-neutropenic for 48h.

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
----------------------------

1. **Overview**

   a. Most common are CTLA-4 inhibitor (ipilimumab) and PD-1/PD-L1
      inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab and
      avelumab).

   b. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) do not significantly immune
      suppress patients when used alone.

2. **Immune toxicity**

   a. If patient develops organ dysfunction, it may be due to immune
      toxicity

      i. consult the service team of the involved organ system and
         inform primary oncologist.

   b. Common immune toxicities include pneumonitis / respiratory failure
      (may be difficult to distinguish between COVID19 disease or may be
      aggravated by COVID19 infection), colitis, endocrine dysfunction
      (thyroid, pituitary / hypothalamic, adrenal), nephritis. Less
      common hepatitis, meningitis, dermatitis.

      i. Check TSH, ACTH, cortisol, T-spot, HIV, HBV, HCV serologies if
         concerned.

   c. Immune toxicities are usually treated with high dose steroids

      i. risks and benefits must be weighed immediately with primary
         oncologist and ID consult teams if immune toxicity is suspected
         concurrent with COVID19 infection.

   d. BWH/DFCI iTox guidelines can be found
      `here <http://dfcionline.org/clinical/clinicalresources/immunotherapy-toxicity/>`__
      on BWH/DFCI intranet.

13: The Role of Palliative Care
===============================

Anxiety
-------

1. **Non-pharmacologic:**

   a. Counseling (Spiritual, Psychocological, SW), Reiki

2. **Pharmacologic**

   a. Benzodiazepines (if patient is not delirious; can use in either
      intubated or non-intubated pts)

      i.  Lorazepam (longer half-life) 0.5-2 mg PO/SL q4-6h PRN; 0.5-2
          mg IV q2h PRN

      ii. Midazolam (shorter half-life) 0.2-0.5 mg IV slowly q 15 min
          PRN or 0.1-0.3 mg/hr IV infusion

   b. SSRI/SNRI: Continue home dose if possible. If NPO, replace with
      prn benzodiazepine

Dyspnea & Acute Pain 
--------------------

Non-opioid management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Non-Pharmacologic for Dyspnea:**

   a. Positioning: sitting patient up in bed, if possible. See also
      *Anxiety* above.

2. **Pharmacologic:**

   a. Please see “Therapeutics” for discussion about NSAID use vs
      acetaminophen. No recommendation is made at this time

   b. Ativan (as above) can be used to ease the anxiety associated with
      dyspnea, but would avoid in patients who have had a previous
      paradoxical reaction (i.e. worsened agitation).

   c. **Opioids** can be used for both **dyspnea** and **acute pain (see
      below)**

Opioid management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **General principles:**

   a. Additional information, including algorithm for opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is available at: `DFCI Pink
      Book <http://pinkbook.dfci.org/assets/docs/pinkBook.pdf>`__

   b. ALWAYS use PRN boluses to address acute, uncontrolled symptoms.
      PRN bolus dosing should be 10-20% of the 24-hour opioid dose

2. **For opioid naive patients:**

+----------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+

a. If patient is not well managed with the above, add opioid infusion:

   i.   Consider drip If > 3 bolus doses in 8 hours

   ii.  Calculate initial dose with total mg used/8 hours

        1. e.g. 1+2+2+2= 7 mg; begin drip at 7mg/8 hr = 1 mg/h

        2. Depending on symptoms and goals of care, consider reducing
           hourly rate by 30-50%. If patient is at end of life, would
           use 100% of hourly rate.

   iii. Continue PRN dosing at current dose (if effective) or titrate as
        per above.

3. **For Opioid tolerant patients:**

   a. If able to take PO:

      i.  Continue current long-acting doses if renal and hepatic
          function tolerate

      ii. Continue current oral PRN dose if effective q4h prn

          1. If ineffective, increase dose by 50% and order range of up
             to 3 x basal dose

             a. e.g. 5 mg PO MS q3h prn; increase to 7.5 mg; 7.5-22 mg
                PO q3h PRN

   b. If unable to take PO, severe or rapidly escalating symptoms:

      i.  Convert as-needed PO doses to IV pushes as needed

          1. Use the IV Conversion chart (see chart below, or `DFCI Pink
             Book <http://pinkbook.dfci.org/assets/docs/pinkBook.pdf>`__)

          2. Decrease PRN dose by ⅓ for incomplete cross-tolerance when
             switching between opioid classes

             a. e.g. to convert 20 mg of oxycodone to IV hydromorphone:
                20 mg oxy = 1.5 mg IV hydromorphone; 1.5 mg x ⅔ =1 mg IV

      ii. Convert PO long-acting/ sustained release opioids to an
          infusion:

          1. Calculate 24-hour dose of PO sustained release (SR)
             morphine

             a. Divide by 3 for the total 24h mg **IV** (Morphine PO/IV
                = 3:1)

          2. Divide the 24h mg IV total by 24h for the hourly drip rate
             (mg)

             a. e.g. 30 mg SR PO morphine q8 hr= 90 mg PO in 24 h; 90 mg
                /3 = 30 mg IV dose; 30 mg / 24 h~ 1 mg/hr IV morphine
                infusion

          3. Continue PRN dosing. PRN dose should be 100-200% of opioid
             drip rate

             a. e.g. 1 mg/hr IV morphine infusion; PRN dose is 1-2 mg IV
                q2h

   b. Warmth, and later cooling and mottling of extremities

   c. Change in respiratory pattern, intermittent apnea, Cheyne-Stokes
      pattern

   d. Gurgling sounds from oropharynx (often more distressing to family
      than patient)

2. Symptom management

   a. Should follow the guidelines provided in sections above

   b. `Intensive Comfort Measures Guidelines (BWH Policy
      5.5.5) <https://hospitalpolicies.ellucid.com/documents/view/2663>`__

3. Communication

Excessive Salivary Secretions at the End of Life
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. For secretions with significant mucous, evaluate benefit/burden of
   repositioning and deep suctioning

2. Communicate with families to expect sounds:

   a. Reassure them that although the “rattling” sound is distressing to
      hear, the patient is not experiencing difficulty breathing or
      having to clear phlegm from his or her throat. The rattling sound
      comes from the movement of air over secretions pooled in the
      throat and airways.

3. Pharmacologic management (not to be used with secretions with
   significant mucous)

   a. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 – 0.4mg IV q2hrs prn secretions, rattling sound

   b. Hyoscyamine 0.125-0.25mg PO q4hrs prn secretions, rattling sound

   c. Scopolamine 1.5mg TD q72hrs if patient not awake and no apparent
      delirium or history of delirium. NB The patch will take ~ 12 hours
      to take effect

   d. Avoid using > 2 of these at the same time; if more than one is
      required, monitor for development of anticholinergic crisis

      ii. For COVID, it is important to make patients and families aware
          that patients with significant comorbid illnesses or who have
          poor baseline functional or health status may decompensate
          rapidly and have very high mortality due to COVID-19 (see

14: Ethical Considerations and Resource Allocation
==================================================

.. _overview-3:

Overview
--------

1. Further details about the BWH and Partners HealthCare model will be
   linked here when available.

2. Below are general considerations and references about resource
   allocation in the setting of scarcity. For a comprehensive framework
   for resource allocation, please see `the model developed Douglas
   White and colleagues at the University of
   Pittsburgh <https://ccm.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/UnivPittsburgh_ModelHospitalResourcePolicy.pdf>`__.

Triage
------

Crisis Standards of Care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A “crisis standard of care” is a set of principles to help guide
   triage when there are insufficient resources (including ICU beds,
   ventilators, dialysis machines, etc.) to meet medical needs
   (`Institute of Medicine
   2012 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32749/>`__).

2. It is triggered by “a substantial change in usual healthcare
   operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, which is
   made necessary by a pervasive (e.g. pandemic influenza) or
   catastrophic (e.g. earthquake, hurricane) disaster” (`Institute of
   Medicine 2012 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32749/>`__)

   a. It must be formally declared by regional/state authorities and
      hospital leadership.

   b. It typically involves contingencies for different stages of a
      crisis

3. It allows transparency. Transparency in decision making, particularly
   when resources are scarce and cannot be allocated to all who are in
   need, is essential (`Biddison et al.
   2014 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144262>`__)

Stages of crisis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image7|
~~~~~~~~

(`Christian et al. 2014 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144591>`__)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Triage principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The goal of triage is to maximize population benefit while treating
   individuals fairly.

   a. This is different from the usual goal in medicine of promoting the
      wellbeing of individuals.

2. The most widely endorsed strategies are to maximize lives saved or
   life-years saved:

   a. Lives saved (no explicit preference given based on age)

   b. Life-years saved (some explicit preference given to younger
      patients all else being equal)

3. Several other strategies have been proposed to allocate scarce
   resources, but have been criticized for failing to maximize benefit
   (`NY State Task Force
   2015 <https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/task_force/reports_publications/docs/ventilator_guidelines.pdf>`__).
   These include:

   a. first-come first served

   b. lottery

   c. preferential allocation (e.g. for healthcare workers)

4. Consensus statement policies (`Biddison et al.
   2014 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144262>`__) suggest no
   ethical difference between withholding and withdrawing care.

Structure of triage teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Consensus guidelines suggest that all decisions about triage are made
   by a Triage Officer, not the bedside clinicians caring for patients
   (`Christian 2014 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144591>`__).

2. The Triage Officer should be a physician with critical care training.

3. Decisions about triage should be made based on protocols established
   by the hospital. These protocols should be evidence based and
   nondiscriminatory (`Gostin & Hanfling
   2009 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952324>`__)

4. Bedside clinicians, patients, and families should have mechanisms for
   appealing triage decisions.

5. An oversight committee should be established to review decisions made
   by Triage Officers to ensure consistent application of the triage
   protocol and to adjudicate appeals.

Duties of Health Care Workers
-----------------------------

1. Regardless of scarcity, clinicians have a duty to care for all
   patients—including by providing compassionate comfort-oriented to
   those who will benefit from it.

   a. The duty to care requires that clinicians accept a reasonable
      level of risk in the provision of care, founded in the principles
      of fidelity, respect for persons, and non-abandonment.

   b. There is a corollary obligation of organizations to ensure risk is
      minimized to clinicians as much as possible through, for example,
      the provision of personal protective equipment (`Veterans Health
      Administration
      2010 <https://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/pandemicflu/Meeting_the_Challenge_of_Pan_Flu-Ethical_Guidance_VHA_20100701.pdf>`__).

15: Intubation
==============

1. *This section is in process*

ADDENDUM: COVID ICU Bundle Checklist 
====================================

Rationale: Use of a daily checklist ensures that routine quality
measures are in place for each patient. Review Bundle Checklist at the
end of each patient’s presentation, every day. Each section should be
performed unless there is a contraindication or barrier to
implementation. If a contraindication is present, discuss how barriers
may be overcome.

   *Setting the lower oxygen limits:*

      There is debate on the proper PaO2 goal, and our rationale relies
      on evidence for lack of benefit from conservative PaO2 goals in
      clinical trials (*i.e.*, PaO2 > 55) and past association between
      lower PaO2 and cognitive impairment, although the evidence is
      certainly not definitive (mean PaO2 71 [IQR 67-80] for cognitively
      impaired survivors versus mean PaO2 86 [IQR, 70-98] in
      non-impaired survivors of ARDS (`Mikkelsen et al, Am J Respir Crit
      Care Med, 2012 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492988>`__).
      In the LOCO\ \ :sub:`2` multi-center, randomized clinical trial,
      patients with ARDS were randomized to their PaO2 55-70, SpO2
      88-92%; or PaO2 90-105, SpO2 >95%); the trial was stopped after
      enrollment of 205 patients due to futility and safety concerns
      (44% mortality in conservative oxygen group versus 30%; (`Barrot
      et al, New Eng J Med,
      2020 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160661>`__).

.. [2]
   *Avoiding hyperoxia:*

      Extensive mammalian animal data demonstrates that hyperoxic injury
      occurs at an FiO2 ≥ 75% (at sea level) with the rate of injury
      increasing as FiO2 exceeds that threshold. In multiple mammalian
      models, an FiO2 of 100% for 48 to 72 hours is associated with
      nearly 100% mortality rate. In lung injury models, the time to
      death is markedly attenuated. In an effort to reduce the potential
      for hyperoxic injury, the threshold of FiO2 ≥ 75% triggers
      progressive intervention throughout this protocol: increased
      sedation, paralysis, proning and ECMO consultation. For a review
      of hyperoxic acute lung injury, see `Kallet and Matthay, Respir
      Care, 2013 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271823>`__.

   Anecdotal reports of efficacy in COVID-19; however data for
   management of secretions in non-CF patients are limited. Dornase is
   relatively costly.
